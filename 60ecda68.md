# MiniKanren caro

Similar to `car`.

Relation which asserts first item in list equivalent to `x` for goal == #s:

```elisp
(caro (grape raisin pear) x) ;; #s iff x == grape

;; (grape)
```

# Definition

``` elisp
(define caro
  (lambda (p a)
    (fresh (d)
      (== (cons a d) p))))
```

`car` takes 1 argument (a list)
`caro` takes 2 arguments (a list `p` and a variable `a`)

Also observe this is *declarative*.

We simply say that given a list `p` and a variable, `a`,
`a` appended to a **fresh variable** has to give us `p`.

It does not talk about the **procedure** we go through to get the head element of the list.

We do not deconstruct `p`.

With `conso`
``` elisp
(define caro
  (lambda (p a)
    (fresh (d)
      (conso a d p))))
```
