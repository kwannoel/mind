# What are zk-SNARKs -- Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge?

Zero-knowledge cryptography.

Proof construction where one can prove possession of information,
without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

For example, given the hash of a random number, the prover could convince the verifier that
there indeed exists a number with this hash value, without revealing what it is.

They can also show that they know this number, without revealing what it is.

Succinct means that proofs can be verified within a few milliseconds,
with a proof length of only a few hundred bytes, even for statements about programs that are very large.

Non-interactive means the proof consists of a single message sent from prover to verifier,
rather than a back and forth.

## Initialization

Initial setup phase, generate a common reference string shared between prover and verifier.
This is referred to as public parameter.

Public parameters are not generated via random source (someone can compromise).
[They are generated in multi-party ceremony](https://electriccoin.co/blog/generating-zcash-parameters/).

## Production

Computation -> Arithmetic Circuit -> R1CS -> QAP -> zk-SNARK

TBC.
