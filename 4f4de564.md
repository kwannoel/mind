# MIPS Performance

## Metric

Performance = 1 / ResponseTime

Speedup = Px / Py = Ry / Rx

where P = Performance, R = ResponseTime

## Influencing factors

Compiling program to binary:

Compiler ISA

Number of instructions

Different compiler generate different binary, e.g. optimization flags

```shell
g++ -O4
```

Changes `instructions` & Average CPI.
