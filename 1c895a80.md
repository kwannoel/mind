# Profiling Haskell programs

A quick 101 on profiling Haskell programs

## Tools

- [criterion](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion)

  Benchmark functions, note that you have to be mindful of laziness, otherwise you might not force a result out of the function.

- [threadscope](https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope)

  Profile runtime heap allocation

- [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/)

  Profile runtime costs of each function. Note ordering might be ambiguous at times, although mostly accurate. I encountered issues when dealing with Lazy IO.

## General setup

Single file just use [ghc profiling flags](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html).

For heap profiling, i.e. via threadscope, make sure to add `-eventlog` when compiling and `+RTS -l` rts option during runtime.

You can specify these in cabal file if you're using cabal / stack.
