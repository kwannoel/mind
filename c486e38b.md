# Removing nixos packages / nixos maintainance / nixos garbage collecting

Remove from configuration.nix

run `nix-collect-garbage`.

If that doesn't cut it, you could have some application running in the background which is accessing your apps. This could be a backup manager / direnv etc...

use `sudo nix-store --query --roots <nix-store-path>/<package-location>`

You can find package location with `ls /nix/store | rg <package-name>`

If you still can't resolve it,

You can brute force rm a package:

```
sudo nix-store --delete --ignore-liveness <package path>
```
