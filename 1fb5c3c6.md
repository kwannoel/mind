# Semaphore with critical section example

Suppose we have a program:
```
Wait(S);
<critical section>
Signal(S);
```

Our semaphore is binary, and has $S_{initial} = 1$.

Let us define $N_{cs}$ as the no. of processes in critical section.

These are the processes which have completed `wait()` but not `signal()`. This is equivalent to `#Wait(S) - #Signal(S)`.

`S_{current}` = 1 + #Signal(S) - #Wait(S)

`S_{current}` + N_{CS} = 1

Since `S_{current}` >= 0 -> NCS <= 1

This usage of semaphore is known as `mutex`.

## Deadlock

$S_{current} = 0$ and $N_{CS} = 0$.

$S_{current}$ + $N_{CS}$ = 1
