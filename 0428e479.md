# Why do you need to perform weighting on term frequencies?

This is because term frequencies do not scale linearly.

Term frequencies indicate relevance of a search term.

Raw term frequency is not accurate, since relevance is not proportional intuitively.

A document with 10 occurrences of a term is more relevant than a document with 1 occurrence. But not 10 times more relevant.
