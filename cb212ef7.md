# Compilers checklist / log

See also <469133ba> for my notes.

1. Do any compilers course.
2. Deep dive into open-source compilers (see below).
   Possible thing todo:
   - How each compiler works at a high level
   - Unique features of each compiler

## Starting out

- [ ] Kaleidoscope: https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html

        Recommend starting out with this.
        It has more hand-holding,
        but it will give you a better intuition of various compiler phases.
        To become good at compilers you will need theory as well.
        Recommend cis341 if you're coming from FP land.
