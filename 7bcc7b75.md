# idf-weighting scheme

$idf_{t} = log_{10}{N/df}$

where `df` is document frequency. see <2d337fae> 

N is the **collection size** and is used to dampen effect of idf. We can also ensure value is non negative. 

We know rare terms are more informative than frequent terms.

As such, we want a high weight for rare terms.
