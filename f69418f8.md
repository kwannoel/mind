# context-free grammars.

Formal grammar of the form `A -> α`.

Where `A` is a single <8ceb7108> symbol, `α` is a string of <4130101f> / nonterminals / empty.

Note: Do not confuse symbol with tokens. Symbols are groupings of tokens.

Set of recursive rules used to generate pattern of strings.

It is "context-free" because replacement of a non-terminal does not depend on surrounding symbols i.e. context.

Examples:
```
stmt -> id = Expr
stmt -> {stmtList}
stmtlist -> stmt
stmtlist -> stmtlist stmt
...
```
