- Start an interactive rebase
```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~<relative position of the commit from HEAD>
```

- Tell git to start rewording commit msg
```
pick <some commit message I want to change>
pick ...
```

```
reword <some commit message I want to change>
pick ...
```

- Git should open up your editor permitting you to change the message
```
<reword message>
```
