# MiniKanren fresh

``` elisp
fresh (x...) g ...
```

Binds fresh variables to `x ...`
and succeeds if the goals `g ...` succeed.

Q: When is a variable fresh?
A: When it has no association.

Examples:

Both q, x are fresh variables at first
```elisp
(run* (q)
  (fresh (x)
    (== #t x)
    (== #t q)))
```

# Law of fresh
If `x` is fresh, `(v x)` succeeds and associates `x` with `v`.

`(v w)` is the same as `(w v)`. (association of fresh variables is commutative)

# [[cfb07694]]  of a fresh variable.

Where x is fresh:
```
x == (_.0)
```
