# p2p architecture

no always-on server

arbitrary end systems directly communicate

peers request service from other peers, provide service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers.

self scalability - new peers bring new service cap, new service demands

peers inermittently connected, change ip addr, complex mgmt.
