### Motivations

Setting up Agda on OSX is not straight-forward, some haskell modules are required and some agda modules are required.

We can of course install these globally, but this pollutes our global namespace.

Alternatively we can use `nix-shell` to give us a sandboxed environment to use `agda`.

### Process

First install [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download.html) on OSX.

Next we want an environment with `Agda`.

We can use [`nix-shell`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-shell) for this.

We provide a `shell.nix` file that tells `nix-shell` what it needs to setup.

`shell.nix` should contain dependencies and `Agda` itself:
- `Agda`
- `Agda standard library`
- `Haskell ieee library`

Looking them up via [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html), their attributes are:
- `haskellPackages.Agda`
- `haskellPackages.ieee`
- `AgdaStdlib`

We want `agda` available to us as a `binary` so we use `mkShell`:
``` nix
pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "agda-with-stdlib";
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.haskellPackages.Agda];
  AGDA_DIR = agdaDir;
}
```

We also want `ghc` used in compiling `agda` programs to have `ieee`:
```nix
agdaGhc = pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (
  haskellPackages: [ pkgs.haskellPackages.ieee ]
);
```
