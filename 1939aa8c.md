First install [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download.html) on OSX.

Next we want an environment with `Agda`.

We can use [`nix-shell`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-shell) for this.

We provide a `shell.nix` file that tells `nix-shell` what it needs to setup.

`shell.nix` should contain:
- `Agda`
- `Agda standard library`

Looking them up via [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html), their attributes are:
- `haskellPackages.Agda`
- `AgdaStdlib`

We want to run `agda` as an executable
