# What are Plutus Monads?

Off-chain parts do not need to worry about compilation to Plutus Core.

Off-chain code is written in Contract Monad,
to deal with side effects and streaming.

## Simulation

EmulatorTrace Monad

- Define actions which wallets invoke with the endpoints, parameters, waiting periods etc...

## Off-chain

Contract Monad

```haskell
newtype Contract w -- Writer monad, allows us to write log msgs
                 s -- Blockchain capabilities / actions, 
                   -- e.g. waiting for slot, submitting tx, getting wallet pubkey
                   --      containing specific endpoints
                 e -- Type of error msgs
                 a
                 = Contract { unContract :: Eff (ContractEffs w s e) a }
      deriving newtype (Functor, Applicative, Monad)
```

## How do we use the type parameter `e`?

Errors can be thrown with:
```haskell
Contract.throwError (errorMsg :: e)
```

And caught with:
```haskell
import Plutus.Contract.Types (handleError)
```

## How do we use type parameter `s`?

In most cases we just use `s ~ BlockChainActions`,
but if we want support for specific endpoints, we must use a different type.

We do so using a type synonym:
```
type MySchema = BlockchainActions .\/ Endpoint "foo" Int
```

This allows us to declare an extra action: Block until endpoint `foo` is called:
```haskell
myContract3 :: Contract () MySchema -- We use MySchema as blockchain capability type
                           Text ()
myContract3 = do
      n <- endpoint @"foo" -- new action not in `BlockchainActions`, but declared in MySchema
      Contract.logInfo n
```

In the emulator trace we can now do:
```haskell
myTrace3 :: EmulatorTrace ()
myTrace3 = do
      h <- activateContractWallet (Wallet 1) myContract3
      callEndpoint @"foo" h 42

test3 :: IO ()
test3 = runEmulatorTraceIO myTrace3
```

Which calls the contract.

## How do we use `w`?

`w` must be monoidic.

We can use it with `observableState`.
