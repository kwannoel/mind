# MinTerm, MaxTerm

MinTerm tells you how to get a 1.

Why? Given 2 variables A and B, if A AND B = 1, we definitely know A and B are both 1.

| X | Y | MinTerm | Notation |
| 0 | 0 | x'.y'   | m0       |
| 0 | 1 | x'.y    | m1       |
| 1 | 0 | x.y'    | m2       |
| 1 | 1 | x.y     | m3       |

MaxTerm is the opposite, it tells you how to get a 0, with +

Why? Given 2 variables A and B, if A OR B = 0, we definitely know A and B are both 0.

| X | Y | MinTerm | Notation |
| 0 | 0 | x+y     | M0       |
| 0 | 1 | x+y'    | M1       |
| 1 | 0 | x'+y    | M2       |
| 1 | 1 | x'+y'   | M3       |
