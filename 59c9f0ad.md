# rdt3.0

- checksum, seq. #, ACKs, retransmissions will be of help but not enough.

  Suppose entire packet does not reach
  
- sender set timeout.
- retransmit if no ACK received in time.
- if pkt / ACK just got delayed (not lost):
  - retransmission will be duplicate, but seq handles this.
  
## Packet structure

| Header       | bits | bytes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Checksum     | 16   | 2     |
| Sequence no. | 16   | 2     |
| Length       | 16   | 2     |

## Scenarios

- Lose packet
  We will timeout
  Resend packet

- Corrupt packet
  Resend packet

- Packet sent after timeout
  Seq no. is duplicated

- Packet Ok
