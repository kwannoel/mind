# What is Flex?

Flex is used for lexical analysis e.g. identifying words in a sentence / tokens in source code.

We specify valid tokens, and provide names for the important ones e.g. `if, else` etc...

This is done via *rules* files in *flex*. Specifying rules is done via its *Rules* section in the file using regex.

*Common REGEX*
```
x      - the character ”x”
"x"    - an ”x”, even if x is an operator.
\x     - an ”x”, even if x is an operator.
[xy]   - the character x or y.
[x -z] - the characters x, y or z.
[^x]   - any character but x.
.      - any character but newline.
^x     - an x at the beginning of a line.
<y>x   - an x when Flex is in start condition y.
x$     - an x at the end of a line.
x?     - an optional x.
x*     - 0,1,2, ...  instances of x.
x+     - 1,2,3, ...  instances of x.
x|y    - an x or a y.
(x)    - an x.
x/y    - an x but only if followed by y.
{xx}   - the translation of xx from the definitions section.
x{m,n} - m through n occurrences of x
```

It then specifies what to do with it in C source code.

Specifying names is done via its *Definitions* section in the file.

*Defining DIGIT*
```
DIGIT [0-9]
```

They also allow helper functions in C (via *Declarations* and *User subroutines*).

Exact syntax of a *rules* file:
```
%{
Declarations
}%
Definitions
%%
Rules
%%
User subroutines
```
