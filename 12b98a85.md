# How to calculate checksum of packet?

We want to detect "errors" in received segments.

1. We chunk the UDP segment into 16-bit integers.
2. Apply binary addition on every 16-bits.

   Wraparound any carries.

3. Compute <33718e9b> . 

   Why do this?
   This checksum is sent to the receiver.
   There, the 3 packets would be added, and we would expect to receive 1111111.
   A computer can efficiently check for 0 (11111), which is why we choose this.
   if any bits were lost along the way, one of the bits would be 0, in that case we can know
   it was corrupted.
