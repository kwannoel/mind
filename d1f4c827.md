# Why rdt3.0 perf is shitty?

Suppose we have the following link:
1 Gbps link
15 ms prop delay, 8000 bit packet.
Dtrans = 8000 / 10^9 = 8ms.

Let's see the utilization time for the sender:

Utilization time = D_trans / round time trip (rtt) + D_trans = 0.008 / 30.008 = 0.027%

throughput sucks: 33kB/sec, since it has to wait synchronously.
