# Stream data processing

Process unbounded data continuously.

## Workflows

- Filtering reduce data volume
- Enrich, might have timestamp etc... might join data with external api to enrich for more info.
- Aggregate data, e.g. takes an average of a minute, rather than fetch every second.
- Event detection, only store when a pattern occurs
