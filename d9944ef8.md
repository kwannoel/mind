# Why use double reference (**x)?

Observe that this usually occurs for `malloc`.

`main`
```c
int *x = malloc(...);
```

Suppose we have a function:
```c
void f(int *x) {
    x = malloc(...);
}
```

In the above case, "x" is bound to local scope, as such in `main` the `x` is unchanged.

```
(main)
x --- | mem |
    /
   /
  /
 /
x (scoped locally)
```

When we do x = malloc(...)

```
(main)
x ---| mem  |
     | ...  |
     | mem2 |
    /
   /
  /
 /
x (scoped locally)
```

We can see that the above x is unchanged.

If we want to reassign above x, we can do:

```
x (scoped locally) --- x (main) --- | mem |
```
