Define a new class based on an existing class.

This class inherits from the existing class.

The inherited class is super / parent class. -> Super type
The inheriting class is sub / child / extended class. -> Sub type

Superclasses are more general, subclasses are more specific

**Java does not permit multi inheritance**

Subclass inherits all members from superclass: fields, methods, nested classes

**It does not inherit constructors**

java.lang.Object class defines and implements common behavior for all classes.
