$$\begin{split}
F(0) &= 0 \\
F(1) &= 1 \\
F(n) &= F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) \ for\ n \geq 2 
\end{split}$$

Observe $2F(n-2) \leq F(n) \leq 2F(n-1).

*We assume by [[9d7c1db2]] that $F(n - 1) \geq F(n - 2)$*

Implies F exponential in n. Assume $F(n) < ab^n$ for some real numbers a, b.

We have to prove:

$$
ab^{n - 1} + ab^{n - 2} \leq ab^n
$$

This is equivalent to $b^2 - b - 1 \geq 0$.

Which is satisfied for $b \geq (\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2$. (We can ignore negative parts because runtime / memory consumption won't be negative)

Note that the `10` supplied here in arbitrary.

**TODO**: include explanation about using 10, due to lower bound in inequality above.

If we use induction to prove the following:

$$
\frac{\phi}{10} \leq F(n) \leq \phi^n \ for\ n \geq 1
$$

Where
$$
\phi = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}
$$


We can attain a asymptotic tight bound: $F(n) = \Theta(\phi^n)$
