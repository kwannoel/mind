# Why use compression?

## Save money by using less disk space

We can achieve compression ratios of 1:4.

## Increase speed by having more data in memory

We have increased used of caching

## Increase speed of data transfer from disk to memory 

- (io compress data | decompress) is faster than io uncompressed data.
- Decompression algorithms are fast
