# Permutations of a list in Haskell

### Using inductive

1. Base case, an empty list has permutations: `[[]]`

2. Suppose we have all permutations of a list, xs.

3. If we were to add an element x to the head of the list,
   The permutations would be inclusive of x.
   Hence we will need to add all possible locations of x to each permutation.

4. Since 1. is true, then 2. is true, then for any list, we can use step 3 to inductively construct all permutations.
   E.g. for [1,2,3,4]
   We construct for:
   a. []
   b. 4:[]
   c. 3:4:[]
   and so on...

5. Hence we obtain all permutations

```hs
perms [] = [[]]
perms (x:xs) = [zs | ys <- perms xs     -- We generate all the permutations of xs
                   , zs <- inserts x ys -- With x inserted at all possible locations in each permutation
               ]
  where
    inserts :: a -> [a] -> [[a]]
    inserts x [] = [[x]]
    inserts x (y:ys) = (x:y:ys) : map (y:) (inserts x ys)
```

### Using recursive, helps with equational reasoning

```hs
perms = foldr step [[]] 
  where step x xss = concatMap (inserts x) xss
```
