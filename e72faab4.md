# Probabilistic AGI

Given information, machine can do anything, with various probabilities weighted.

Behaviour is non-deterministic.

Machine has choice.

## Test cases

We give machine its own source.
Tell the machine probabilities of what it will do.
Probabilities simply update. Machine can act as they wish.

## What machine needs

- Modify probabilities
- Incentives / look at self-learning, how do machines do that.
- Incentive is self-discovery?
- Or maybe we can simulate an environment with resources, machines try to optimize source to get more resources.
- Self preservation?
