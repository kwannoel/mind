# permuterm index

For a particular term, we store all wrapped permutations of it

```
eat$ at$e t$ea $eat
```

Then, when we perform queries, we can do the following:

## Querying special forms

X -> X$

\*X -> X$\*

X\*Y -> Y$X\*

X\* -> $X\*

\*X\* -> X\*

## Problems

Clearly the lexicon size blows up now need to store N-words where N is the number of characters in the original word.
