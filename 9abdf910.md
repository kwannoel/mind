### 1s-complement
Only 2 conditions:
positive + positive = negative -> bit overflow
negative + negative = positive -> bit overflow

For:
positive + negative -> won't ever overflow
In the worst case:
max_positive + max_negative = max_positive + 0
                            = max_positive

The magnitude range:
0 <= positive + negative <= max_positive

### 2s-complement
Same as 1s-complement

#### Examples

A = -7 = 1001
B = -6 = 1010

result = -13 = 1 0011

It is clear that there is overflow here.
