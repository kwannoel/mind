## What is it?

An arrow `a b c` takes input something of type `b` and outputs `c`

It is used as a way to model computations.

Some examples of arrows:

```haskell
-- type representing a computation
data MyArr b c = MyArr (b -> (c,MyArr b c))
instance Arrow MyArr b c where

-- Functions are arrows too
instance Arrow (->) b c where
```

To run an arrow computation:
```haskell
-- run a function arrow
runF :: (b -> c) -> b -> c
runF = id

-- run a MyArr arrow, discarding the remaining computation
runMyArr :: MyArr b c -> b -> c
runMyArr (MyArr step) = fst . step
```

## Usecases:

- Processing lists of inputs

    In this case the computation model can implicitly make use of state without exposing the state to the programmer
    ```haskell
    -- run a function arrow over multiple inputs
    runFList :: (b -> c) -> [b] -> [c]
    runFList f = map f

    -- run a MyArr over multiple inputs.
    -- Each step of the computation gives the next step to use
    runMyArrList :: MyArr b c -> [b] -> [c]
    runMyArrList _ [] = []
    runMyArrList (MyArr step) (b:bs) = let (this, step') = step b
                                    in this : runMyArrList step' bs
    ```

- Combining computations:

    ```haskell
    -- function that, given an input n, returns "n+1" and "n*2"
    calc1 :: Int -> (Int,Int)
    calc1 = (+1) &&& (*2)
    ```

- Streams:

    Works well for streams probably but I don't have any examples :P
