# NP hardness of dominating set (reduction from Vertex Cover)

[[8b0b2fd4]]

## Definitions

We have a graph $G = (V, E)$.

We define the **dominating set**, $V'$ to be a subset of of $V$.

For all edges in E, one of the vertices of the edge has to in $V'$.

If there is a vertice not part of any edge, it should be in $V'$ as well.

## Problem

Is there a dominating set of vertices of a specific size?

## Reduction

We want to find a vertex cover for a graph, $G* = (V*, E*)$.

Transform this graph into $G = (V, E)$.

Initialize $V = V*, E = E*$.

For every edge in $E*$:

- create a new vertex $v_{x,y}$, add to V.
- create 2 edges $(x, v_{x, y})$ and $(y, v_{x, y})$, add to E.

## Assertion we want to prove

Show that $G*$ has a vertex cover of size $k$, iff $G$ has a dominating set of $k'$.

## Proving

### Definitions

$|V*| = n$

$m$ = no of isolated vertices in $V*$

$k$ = vertex cover of $G*$

### Steps

Vertex cover, k excludes isolated vertices. As such we need to add it in.

k' = k + m.

#### Show if k -> k'

v1, ..., vk = vertex cover of $G*$.

u1, ..., um = isolated vertices in $V*$.

We want to show V1 = {v1, ..., vk, u1, ..., um} is a dominating set in G.

For any vertex v not in V1, it is not an isolated vertex, otherwise it would have been included.

If v ∈ V*, there is some vertice in V1, such that v forms an edge with it (definition of vertex cover).

If v ∉ V*, v_{x, y} for some edge (x, y) in V*. One of x / y is in ${v1, ..., vk}$.

|V1| = k + m = k'.

#### Show if k' -> k

Transform $V1$, such that if there are any $v_{x, y}$ nodes, we can swap them out for x / y to get a dominating set of the same size.

Let Vn = {v1, ..., vk} be set of all the non-isolated vertices in the dominating set.

Consider an edge x, y, where none of x, y is in Vn.

Then $v_{x, y}$ is not dominated by the dominating set, which is a contradiction.
