# UDP

## Properties

Uses <ef0bf617> model.

<3fcbedd7>

Integrity verification - <12b98a85> 

## Why use UDP?

Fast

In scenarios where we do not need error checking or correction, we could use it.

Otherwise in other protocols like <6412886d> , we would have extra overhead to process the packets.

Control over reliability on app level.

## Attributes

- Transaction oriented - query - response
- datagrams - model ip tunneling / rpc / nfs
- simple - can bootstrap with it, without having a full protocol stack (e.g. DHCP, FTP)
- Stateless
- No retransmission delay - real-time app (VoIP, games)
- multicast support
