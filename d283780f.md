# XOR

This is interesting because you can use XOR again to get one of the LHS components.

Let's use `^` to denote XOR.

Lets say we have `a ^ b = c`.
We can reverse it to get back a: `a = c ^ b`.

XOR
| a | b | c | c ^ b |
|---|---|---|-------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0     |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1     |
