Goals:
- Mutable data
- With a friendly API
- Speed

For example with Array there might be an array within an IO Monad / State Monad etc...

Single threaded use of data

- Makes more sense to mutate the data rather than copying
- d1 -- mutate --> .. -- mutate --> dn

- Improving speed

- Post Order
- Removing a source and prepending it to a list repeatedly
