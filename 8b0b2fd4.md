# Vertex Cover

Set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph.

Note: **at least**.

This means that the vertex cover does not have to be minimum.

```
A - B - C
```

In the above undirected graph, we can have vertex cover = 2 {B, C}, although it is not minimal (we can have just {B}).
