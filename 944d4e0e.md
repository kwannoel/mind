Key concepts to understand first:
- <184670c7> 
- <20768481> 

### What Ownership addresses
- Which parts of code are on the heap
- Minimizing duplicate data on the heap
- Cleaning up unused data on the heap

### Ownership rules
- Each value has a variable called its *owner*.
- Only can have 1 *owner* at a time
- When owner out of scope, value dropped.

### Example of ownership
- The string type, `String`

### What the borrow checker does
Given the following error
```rs
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1);
```
You will get this error
```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
2 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
4 | 
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value borrowed here after move

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `ownership`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

Reason being `s1` is considered invalid after it's value is moved to `s2`.
Hence, no memory has to be freed when s1 moves out of scope.

If we were to keep `s1` valid along with `s2`, it leads to a `double-free` error, because both `s1` and `s2` attempt to free them same location on the heap of memory.

If `s1` frees the memory first, there is a dangling reference from `s2` to the memory and vice-versa.

### What if we really want to duplicate the data?
Implement and use the `Clone` trait.

### Stack-only Data: Copy
When variables are bound to these, they can still be reused as the values implement the `Copy` trait.

Types have a known size at compile time have `Copy`:
- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that are also `Copy`. For example, (`i32`, `i32`) is `Copy`, but (`i32`, `String`) is not.
