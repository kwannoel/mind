# imperative language: denotate assignment

## Requirements

Assignment is only possible with some way to persist the name-value binding.
We can do this via a **store**.

When we perform assignment, the new store is no longer the same as the previous store, so we denote it as such:

```
∑ -> ∑'
   ^-------- assignment occurs, e.g. x=1
```

As such we preserve <e19c57b4> laws:

1. Any name in a given environment (inclusive of store, ∑) evaluates to the same value.
2. Any expression in a given environment (inclusive of store, ∑) evaluates to the same value.
