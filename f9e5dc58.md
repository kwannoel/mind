# Why recursive or iterative DNS?

## Faults of recursive DNS

- Recursive DNS servers are more vulnerable to DOS
  - https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack/
  - TLDR:
    - DNS resolution is typically UDP.
    - You can do fire and forget, similar to <06e9912a> 
    - Just attach the IP of your target for DDos'ing.
    - DNS resolution response can be really large:
      - 64 byte query -> 3223 byte response
      - ~50x amp.
    - So now your botnet is 50x more powerful and can cripple many more websites.

- DNS cache poisoning
  - Trick DNS into believing a fake DNS query repsonse is authentic.
  - Since responses are cached, users will use the fake info.

- <acb33aa9> performance degradation
  If DNS servers are not configured correctly,
  queries using RFC1918 addressing (private addressing)
  may be leaked to RNS, causing degradation in service for legitimate queries to those serers.
