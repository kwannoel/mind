# State Management in Apache Flink (Notes)

### What are key takeaways

- Managing application state.
- Strong consistency guarantees.
- Adaptivity to cluster reconfig.

### What is meant by transparent and non-intrusive?

### What is meant by application state declared explicitly?

### How does this help efficient partitioning?

### How are stream databases used in contrast to traditional databases?

- Traditional database will share access to a db instance, perform computation on that instance.
- Stream database on the other hand will perform computation,
  where n people can subscribe to various computations.
