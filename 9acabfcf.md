# Cardano Transaction Metadata

We want to allow arbitrary structured data to be included on-chain.

Transactions can contain metadata.

It is kept outside of transaction body, like <9e8c13a6>.

No data added to ledger state.

Resides only on chain.

Contributes on to transaction size and fees.

Data is not kept in random-access storage

Example use:

Suppose we wish to track issuance of physical items.
