# Is the free names relation: "><" a total function?

For all primitive expressions, there is a injective relation.

Higher level expressions build on primitives:

p1, p2, ? :.

There exists an injective relation for these expressions, if their child expression also has an injective relation.

Since we can reduce every expression to primitive, we know that child expression definitely have injective relation.
