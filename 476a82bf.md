# What are examples of structured vs unstructured data?

Structured data refers to information in "tables", data with a known schema.

E.g.

| Employee | Manager | Salary |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Smith    | Jones   | 5000   |
| Chang    | Smith   | 6000   |
| ...      | ...     | ...    |

Unstructured data on the other hand refers to information which has no clear structure, e.g. text from books.

That being said, usually data is just semi-structured, linguistics still has some structure for text, and bullets.
