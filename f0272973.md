# Tezos

## Accounts

Implicit - non programmable, tagged to public key

Smart contract - programmable.
Transaction can contain data, fail for reasons decided by michelson code.
Address unique hash that depends on operation that created it.
Address starts with `KT1`.

Both are indistinguishable.

## Smart contract languages

### Michelson

Stack based, strict static type checking.
Values are immutable and garbage collected.
types of input, output stack are fixed, monomorphic.
Program is typechecked.

### SmartPy

Embedded DSL in python.
Users can write and implement test scenarios to test their smart-contracts.

Compiles to imperative, type inferred intermediate language called SmartML.

SmartML in turn compiles to Michelson.

### LIGO

LIGO supports:
- CameLIGO - OCaml inspired syntax
- ReasonLIGO - functional Javascript-like syntax inspired by ReasonML
- PascaLIGO - Pascal inspired syntax.

LIGO -> IR -> typecheck -> Michelson.

### Morley framework

Collection of projects which build upon and complement each other.

#### Morley

Haskell framework for meta-programming Michelson smart contracts.

Morley (.mtz) - superset of Michelson, with simpler syntax, simple features.

Library with core Tezos, Michelson datatypes & tools for typechecking, interpreting, parsing and printing Michelson, Morley contracts.

Executable with commands for compiling and working with Morley and Michelson contracts,
along with a REPL for interactively running instructions.

#### Lorentz

eDSL in Haskell
- Expressive type system
- type inference
- Type safe
- Reuse components as Haskell packages
- Autogen docs

#### Indigo

eDSL in Haskell
- imperative style programming,
  free you from manual stack management.

#### Cleveland

Testing Michelson contracts.

Example based, property based tests.

#### Archetype

Transpilation of contracts to SmartPy, LIGO.

Formal verification.
