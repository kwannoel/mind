# Prims algorithm

### Overarching idea

Build a subgraph by repeatedly choosing the minimum edge connecting the subgraph to another vertice.

### Steps 

1. Choose a vertex as the initial MST subgraph, S.

2. Choose the minimum edge which connects S to any other vertex in the graph, G.
   This vertex should not be connected to S.

3. Repeat step 2. 

### Proof of correctness

#### Proof by contradiction

Assume Prim's algorithm does not given an MST.

Let M be a MST for a weighted graph G = (V, E).

We know PRIM constructs a sequence of trees $T_{i}$, where $T_{i}$ contains i vertices and i-1 edges.

Let $T_{k+1}$ be the first tree that has an edge not contained in the MST.

Using the cut property to $T_{k}$ and $V - T_{k}$:

- The min cost edge from $T_{k}$ to $V - T_{k}$ must be in min spanning tree

- Prim's algorithm chooses that edge by definition

- Hence $T_{k+1}$ must have the same edges as the MST.
