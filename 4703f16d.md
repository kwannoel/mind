Common traits such as `Add`, `Mul` have *associated types*.

You can find this in the declaration of these traits: 
- [Add](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/ops/arith.rs.html#75-84)
- [Mul](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/ops/arith.rs.html#297-306)

Both use `Output` as their associated type.

This is an auxilary type which can then be used in declarations.

``` rs
pub struct Vec3<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
    z: T,
}

impl <T: Add<Output = T>> Add for Vec3<T> {
    type Output = Self; // Bind auxilary type
    fn add(self, other: Vec3< T >) -> Self::Output {
                                      // Use it for the return value
        Self {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
            z: self.z + other.z,
        }
    }
}
```

It has the advantage of providing a uniform interface and flexibility (by choosing what to bind to the type).

The confusing part for me was seeing two places in which it seemed to be bound:

``` rs
impl <T: Add<Output = T>> Add for Vec3<T> {
           // ^
           // Bound here (1)

      // Bound here (2)
      // v
    type Output = Self; // Bind auxilary type
    fn add(self, other: Vec3< T >) -> Self::Output {
        Self {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
            z: self.z + other.z,
        }
    }
}
```

After doing some digging, for **(1)**, `Output = T` is scoped to the trait binding of `T`.
In plain english, we are saying `T` implements the trait `Add` which has defined `Output` type as T.

Hence because this is scoped to **(1)**, the binding does not overlap with **(2)**.
