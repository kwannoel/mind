# Multiplexing (Muxing)

This means combining multiple streams into 1 complex stream,
using the same transport medium.

Note: here transport does not refer specifically to <8198d3d1> ,
rather the channel through which we are transporting the information stream.
So this could refer to transports in other layers, see: <d10c4bc2> 

Used to share a scarce resource.

To do the reverse: <1e89cb0f> 
To do the inverse: <9d451b45>
