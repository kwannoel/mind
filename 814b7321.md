# Difference between poisson and binomial distribution

A poisson distribution specifies the probability within a fixed interval, but with a infinite sample (or very large).

e.g. 1 / 1000 numerical error, sample size = 10,000

A binomial distribution specifies the probability within a finite sample.

e.g. 25% failure for next 15.
