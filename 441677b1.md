l -> 4
mn -> 5
r -> 6

3. Recursively collpase pair of consecutive identical digits into 1.
  
  ```
  333 -> 33 -> 3
  ```

4. Remove all zeros
5. Pad resulting string with trailing zeros, return first 4.

## Example

```
Herman

H06505 -> perform 2.
H06505 -> perform 3.
H655   -> perform 4.
H65500 -> perform 5.
H655   -> perform 5.
