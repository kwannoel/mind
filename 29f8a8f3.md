# Masters Theorem

<3dc783ec>

The recurrence **T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)** can be solved as follows.

For all large enough n,

$If a ⋅ f(n /b) ≤ αf(n )$ for some $α < 1$, then $T(n ) = O( f(n ))$

If a ⋅ f(n /b) ≥ βf(n ) for some β > 1, then $T(n ) = O(a^{\log_{b}n} )$

If a ⋅ f(n /b) = f(n ) then $T(n ) = Θ( f(n) \log_{b}n )$
