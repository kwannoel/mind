If you think about conventional browsers, the clients only support javascript, html, php, and now WebAsm

I want to write haskell for scripting however. This should be natively supported, such that we do not have to transpile from haskell to javascript

We can perhaps just reuse one: GTK

Then we just fetch from "sources" these can be git, dns etc...
