If you think about conventional browsers, the clients used to only support javascript, html, php.

If we wanted to use other languages we had to compile down to javascript. However this had performance limitations.

With web assembly, we can now compile down to it from other languages.

For instance [asterius](https://github.com/tweag/asterius) compiles `Haskell` down to `web assembly`.
