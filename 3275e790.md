# rdt2.0

- Channel may flip bits in packet (use <12b98a85> ).

- error detection
- feedback: control msgs (ACK, NAK) from receiver to sender

- Send acknowledgements (ACKs)
  receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt is OK

- Send negative ack (NAKs)
  receiver tells sender that pkt had errors
  sender retransmits pkt

Fun question:
