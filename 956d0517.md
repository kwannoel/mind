# NFTs on Cardano

Should only be able to mint 1.

Naive solution proposal:
- Set forge field amount to 1.
- Does not work, we can submit many transactions, all minting one at a time.

Second option is to use existing NFT support,
using deadlines.
This guarantees that after deadline no new tokens will be minted.

However this is not a strong guarantee,
you are reliant on external tools: blockchain explorer.
The currency symbol alone does not suffice to guarantee uniqueness.

We need something which can only exist in a single transaction.

To do so, we can use UTxOs.

UTxOs are uniquely identified by transaction ID, and its index in the lists of outputs from Tx.

## Minting an NFT

We provide a specific UTxO to minting policy, and check that transaction consumes this UTxO.

Once a UTxO is consumed, it can never be consumed again.
