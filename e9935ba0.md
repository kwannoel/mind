# What is a discrete random variable?

Given X, a random variable (see: [[e9935ba0]] )

If the function range (output values) is [[2db3b890]] , X is a discrete random variable.

## Example: Discrete random variables

X: S -> Z

Where Z is the set of integers

## Example: Non-Discrete random variables

X: S -> F

Where F is the set of floats.
