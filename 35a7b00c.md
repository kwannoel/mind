### How do we define a `Natural`?

First we observe that it is an `inductive` type.

It has a base case `zero` and inductive case `suc` to get to the next natural.

So we can define it as:

```agda
data N : Set where
  zero : N
  suc  : N -> N
```

Note here that an inductive definition without a base case is useless, we have nothing to begin with.
