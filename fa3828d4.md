# Record screen with FFMPEG

*Taken from: * https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Capture/Desktop

# macOS

Use the avfoundation device:

```
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -devices true -i ""
```

This will enumerate all the available input devices including screens ready to be captured.

Once you've figured out the device index corresponding to the screen to be captured, use:

```
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -r 1 -probesize 20M -threads 1 -i "1:none" -vcodec libx264 -b:v 128k -s hd720 /Users/kwannoel/Sync/CS2104/0406988-cs2104-finals.mp4
```

To view the video:

```
ffplay <video>
```
