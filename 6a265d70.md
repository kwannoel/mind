# How do we handle wildcard queries?

## word\*

Using [[b88784ec]] allows us to find words in range word <= w < wore

## \*word

If we want to find *word will be a bit harder, need to maintain another B-tree with inverse ordering. (right-to-left characterwise)

## word*dorw

## word* AND *word

In order to be more efficient, since we have to perform intersection merge, in the above example,

## Other efficient ways

We can use a [[06847798]].

We can use a [[abddb644]]
