# Network Address Translation (NAT)

## Why do we need this?

Not practical for homeowners to have to understand ip address,
and configure it for each device.

Not scalable as well, one can have many devices.

## How to abstract this concern away for homeowners?

- Permit hosts to change ISPs without changing
  addresses of hosts in the local network.

- To do so we can have private IP address ranges 
  that will not be used on the public Internet.
  Address spaces within these private ranges
  can thus been used for hosts on private networks.

- Network Address Translation: Translates data-
  grams containing these private addresses to use the
  routerâ€™s IP instead.
  
## How do external parties communicate with homeowner?

- To the public Internet,
  it looks like the all the devices are actually
  one device, which is the NAT-enabled router itself.

- NAT Translation Table: For each host in the private network,
  a specific port on the router will be used for it.
  It stores the IP address and port number for the WAN and LAN sides.
  
## How does it protect local devices?

- Hosts inside a network are not explicitly
  addressable.
