# Virtual machines / Hypervisors

Why do we want this? Operating Systems are closely mapped to hardware architecture.

This means whenever we setup an OS, we need to run initializers to configure compatibilities with hardware.

We can provide out of the box compatibilities, by *virtualizing hardware*.

Virtual machines are also known as hypervisors.

## Types of VM / Hypervisors

(Type 1)
- Run directly on hardware e.g. Xen supervisor

(Type 2)
- On top of OS
