# minting policies in Plutus

A transaction can't create / delete tokens, unless minting policy permits.

The only thing that gets removed is lovelace fee (transaction fees).

Currency symbol is constructed form hexadecimal symbols,
because it is hash of minting policy script.

This is invoked for validation whenever we create / burn tokens,
after being informed by the transaction's context.
