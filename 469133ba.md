# Compiler

A compiler takes in programs of a language, produces programs of a language.

If we think deeper, what are required of such a function?

A mapping! Different parts of the program should map to the output.

To get this different parts we use <b1b8dbea> which gives us our syntactic tokens, e.g. `if, else, let`.

Then we use <428bf7e3> to create an <31cd1074> which has an interface we can work with.

We then have <ded7375c> to understand the <1ef598c7> of our source program, and finally use <32242df1> to output program in target language.
