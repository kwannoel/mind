# Compiler

A compiler takes in programs of a language, produces programs of a language.

If we think deeper, what are required of such a function?

A mapping! Different parts of the program should map to the output.

To get this different parts we use [[b1b8dbea]].
Produces lexed IR which gives us our syntactic tokens, e.g. `if, else, let`.

Then we use [[428bf7e3]] to create an [[31cd1074]] which has an interface we can work with.
Produces parse tree IR. Note that loops are not considered because they still contain parse tree structure.

We then have [[ded7375c]] to understand the [[1ef598c7]] of our source program,

and finally use [[32242df1]] to output program in target language.

More IRs may be produced through various phases: Typechecking, sem analysis, optimization, codegen.

Frontend - Machine independent parts.
Backend - Machine dependent parts.

## Phases

- [[b1b8dbea]] 
- [[428bf7e3]] 
- [[ded7375c]] 
- [[d40d0663]] 
- [[32242df1]]
- [[9f541b3d]] 
- control-flow
- inlining of assembly as machine code
  - Hardcodes memory allocations statically,
  - Normal instructions get this during runtime

## Common tools used

- yacc, bison, (f)lex
  Not modern but stable. No inbuilt support for unicode.

- ANTLR
