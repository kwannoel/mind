# Why use threads?

## TLDR

We still want to perform concurrent programming.

However, [[928a404b]] and [[dfbefd23]] is difficult!

We wanted a quick hack to deal with these problems.

## Pros

### Economical

Multiple threads in the same process requires much less resources to manage compared to multiple processes

### Resource sharing

- Threads share most of the resources of a process
- No need for additional mechanism for passing information around

### Responsiveness

- Multithreaded programs much more responsive

### Scalability

- Multithreaded program can take advantage of multiple CPUs

## Cons

- syscall concurrency
  - parallel execution of multiple threads -> parallel syscall.
  - need to ensure correctness, since syscall is effectful.
  
- process behaviour
  - impact on process operations
  - fork() duplicates a process, how about its threads?
  - exit() executes exit(), how about the whole process?
  - exec() single thread calls it, what about other threads?
