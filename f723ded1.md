# How to use POSIX thread (pthread)?

Header file:
```
#include <pthread.h>
```

Compilation (flag is system dependent)
```
gcc XXXX.c -lpthread
```

Useful datatypes:
```
pthread_t: Data type to represent a thread id (TID)
pthread_arr: Data type to represents attributes of a thread.
```

See `man pthread_create`, `man pthread_exit` for more info
