# ip address

A series of numbers which identifies computer / internal network -> connected to internet.

An IP address generally looks like this:

AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD, where digits are 001-255.

In a home IP / small network, you generally have IP range:

192.168.1.DDD, around 250 address you can use.

Total permutations are 255**4 which is roughly 4 billion. However, this is not enough. That's why now we have IPv6 addresses.
