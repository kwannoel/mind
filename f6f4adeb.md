Cannot be instantiated, can be subclassed.

Use to represent common parts of subclasses.

For instance, `Animal` class can exist as an abstract class of `Cat`, `Dog`, `Horse`, `Tiger`...

If a class has an [[c21c73c7]] it becomes an abstract class since it is impossible to create objects with an incomplete class definition.

Their `type` can be *referenced*.

In Java, even without abstract methods we can still declare as abstract class.

Subclasses can be abstract as well.
