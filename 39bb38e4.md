# Pitfalls of using asymptotic notation over a limited domain

Case study:

We prove that $T(n) = O(n)$ when n is an exact power of 2.

If n is defined the following way however:
$$
T(n) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
    n   &if n = 1, 2, 4, 8... \ (powers \ of \ 2) \\
    n^2 &otherwise \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
$$

We realize that $T(n) = O(n^2)$ instead.

This is a result of only looking at the domain: 

$$
\{n^{2p} \ | \ ∀ n, p ∈ Ζ \}
$$
