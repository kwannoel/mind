# MIPS ALUControl

![](./static/mips-alu-ctrl-sig.png)

It depends on both <4958e2bb> and <0ce799a9> .

## Approach

- Naive
  
  Brute force, use opcode + function code, deal with 12 input bits.
  
- Pro

  <fac2298b> .
  
  Use some of the input to reduce cases, generate output.
  
  Reduce size of the main controller + up the ease of design + circuit speedup.
