Stores values in the order it gets them, removes values in opposite order.

All values stored have a known size at *compile time*.

Faster than storing to heap, don't need to find location since it is always at top of the stack.

When code calls a function, the values are passed into the function, including pointers to data on the heap.

The function's local variables get pushed onto the stack.
