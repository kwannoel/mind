# Subtyping vs subclassing

Subtyping means subtype preserves all properties of supertype

Subclassing means subclass preserves class methods of super class, but may override their behaviour.

What does this mean?

Suppose we have a `set` which extends from a super class `list`. It still has the method `add` which allows us to add an element to the list.

However, although it is a valid `subclass` since it preserves all methods, the properties of set is different from list. It is no longer ordered. As such, it can't be a subtype.
