# My overdue post on free monads

## Intuition

Just like how we can get a free Monoid (`[]`) for a type `t`.

We can get a free Monad for a functor F.

The methodology is the same, build up repeated contexts:
```haskell
data [a] = [] | a : [a]
data Free f a = Pure a | Roll (f (Free f a))
```

Let's see how we define the instances for `Free`.

```haskell
data Free f a = Pure a | Roll (f (Free f a))

class Functor f => Functor (Free f) where
  fmap f (Pure a) = Pure $ f a
  fmap f (Roll x) = Roll (fmap (fmap f) x)

class Functor f => Monad (Free f) where
  return = Pure a
  Pure a >>= f = f a
  Roll x >>= f = concatFree (fmap f x)
      where
          --AKA join ::              m      (m      a) -> m      a
          concatFree :: Functor f => Free f (Free f a) -> Free f a
          concatFree (Pure x) = x
          concatFree (Roll y) = Roll (fmap concatFree y)
          -- E.g.
          --   concatFree $ Roll (Identity (Pure (Roll (Identity (Pure a)))))
          -- = Roll (fmap concatFree $ Identity (Pure (Roll (Identity (Pure a))))) -- Essence of why concatFree works
          -- = Roll (Identity (concatFree $ Pure (Roll (Identity (Pure a)))))
          -- = Roll (Identity (Roll (Identity (Pure a))))
```

## Why is it useful?

As I was thinking how we can use DSLs to model computations e.g. IO, I came across *free monads*.

A familiarity with [[4e8e9ebb]] is expected in this post.

In our case, we want to factor out impure parts from any code using *free monads*.

Free monads allows us to decompose any impure program into a pure representation of its behavior and a minimal impure interpreter.

Suppose we want to model IO parts:
```haskell
-- | Taken from haskell for all (see references)
import Control.Monad.Free
import System.Exit hiding (ExitSuccess)

data TeletypeF x
  = PutStrLn String x
  | GetLine (String -> x)
  | ExitSuccess

instance Functor TeletypeF where
    fmap f (PutStrLn str x) = PutStrLn str (f x)
    fmap f (GetLine      k) = GetLine (f . k)
    fmap f  ExitSuccess     = ExitSuccess

type Teletype = Free TeletypeF

putStrLn' :: String -> Teletype ()
putStrLn' str = liftF $ PutStrLn str ()

getLine' :: Teletype String
getLine' = liftF $ GetLine id

exitSuccess' :: Teletype r
exitSuccess' = liftF ExitSuccess

-- Our interpreter
run :: Teletype r -> IO r
run (Pure r) = return r
run (Free (PutStrLn str t)) = putStrLn str >>  run t
run (Free (GetLine  f    )) = getLine      >>= run . f
run (Free  ExitSuccess    ) = exitSuccess

echo :: Teletype ()
echo = do str <- getLine'
          putStrLn' str
          exitSuccess'
          putStrLn' "Finished"

main = run echo
```

It seems like we paid a price however...? Our program is more much verbose... and... we still seem to have an error as shown below
```haskell
import System.Exit

main = do x <- getLine
          putStrLn x
          exitSuccess
          putStrLn "Finished" -- <-- oops!
```

There is no way to prove it. For instance exitSuccess could be redefined as `exitSuccess = return ()`.
That way `"Finished"` still gets printed to stdout.
