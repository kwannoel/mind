# How do we map cache?
Memory Address
31 to N
N - 1 to 0
Cache Block size = 2^N bytes (N is offset)

Memory Address
31 to N+M-1 -> Tag
N+M-1 to N -> Index
N-1 to 0 -> Offset
Cache Block size = 2^N
Number of cache blocks = 2^M
Offset = N Bits

# Purpose of offset
Tells us which word to return

e.g. offset = 0100

Data = | I | J | K | L

We return J.

# How to check for cache hit?

cache[index].valid == True && cache[index].tag = tag

# Example
Block Number (Not address)
00000 -> 00
00001 -> 01
00010 -> 10
00011 -> 11
00100 -> 00 (Repeat)
00101 -> 01

Cache Index
00
01
10
11
...

# Example
Block 12 go to which number?
12 mod 4 -> Take last 2 bits
01100 -> 00

If number of cache blocks = $2^M$

Tip:
Cache index of n = M last bits of n

Multple blocks can be mapped to the same cache block, but the tag number is different
e.g. 000 00 and 
     001 00 both map to 00
     but tag number 000 and 001 is different.

# Cache miss

Try to get from Cache

Cannot get! -> Get from memory

# Cold miss
32K direct mapped cache

128k array -> no way we can fit everything in

# Conflict miss
32K direct mapped cache

2*8k array -> Cfm can fit. But! They are both aligned, map to same set. This means they will not utilize the full cache size and compete for the same sets (conflict).

# Types of cache

[[45d3912d]]

# Summary
Hit: Data in cache
 - Hit rate: Fraction of memory accesses that hit
 - Hit time: Time to access cache
 
Miss: Data is not in cache
- Miss rate = 1 - Hit rate
- Miss penalty
