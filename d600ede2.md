# IPv4 subnet

How to check if an address belongs to subnet?

You can check your subnet mask.

For example if your subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`,
the first 24bits / 3bytes will be the same if you are in same subnet.

e.g. if your ip is `192.0.2.1`,
you any other ip in the same subnet should be `192.0.2.X`.

You could also denote this as 192.0.2.1/24, to indicate the first 24bits are reserved.
