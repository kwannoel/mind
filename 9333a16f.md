# Cantor's paradox

**TBD: PROOF**

1. For any set X, the [[36d06c76]] of X has strictly larger cardinality than X.

If X is the "set" of all sets, we have a contradiction.

X should be the largest set, it should contain itself and all the subsets of X as well.

From 1. this cannot be true since its power set is now larger.
