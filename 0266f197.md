# Understanding linear types in Haskell [WIP]

Main motivation is that stated in [linear types motivations - Tweag](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/examples)

I would like to benchmark performance of linear type approach vs non-linear type approach when dealing with transport of large amounts of data.
