# How are processes scheduled?

First, we understand that processes are stored in: <af4b7678> 

Next, we have a series of <6e4efa0d> . These queues will have a head and tail, which points to a <457568a2> of <3e05cd83> 

To store processes,

We have the following queues:

- <55993b3e> 

- <d71fa8ba> 

As well as on disk.

<467ec3e5>

Then we extract processes from these using <d17f223b> 
as well as using a <800cd4c7> 

Sometimes we also have a <c48fbaad>
