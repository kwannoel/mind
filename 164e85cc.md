# Semaphore state interaction example

3 Processes: P1, P2, P3

Initial state:
S=1

State 1: 
S=1, P1 wait(S) -> P1 proceeds
Since S > 0, P1 does not block, proceeds

State 2:
S=0, P2 wait(S) -> P2 suspended
Since S <= 0, P2 is suspended (waiting)

State 3:
S=0, P3 signal(S) -> P3 proceeds
Since S <= 0, 

End State:
S=1
