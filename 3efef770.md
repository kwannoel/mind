# Glow Command line internals

A command line tool has a few parts:
1. parser to parse command line options.
2. handlers to deal with the parsed datastructure.

## Where exactly is `glow cli` defined?

We can invoke it with `./glow`,
which invokes `main.ss`.
In there, it runs the following:
```
(current-program "glow")
(initialize-glow-path!)
(define-multicall-main)
```

Let's analyze this section by section:
```
(current-program "glow")
;; is evaluated to
((make-parameter []) "glow")
```

### What is `make-parameter`?

If we look at [Gambit - make-parameter](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html#index-make_002dparameter),
we know that the environment of execution has 2 parts:
1. local
2. global

We first access `local` environment, if a variable can't be found, we then try `global`.
A new cell is instantiated and bound to a new parameter object.
The content of this cell is `[]`.
Whenever an argument, in this case `"glow"`,
is passed to the parameter object the contents get updated.
If no arguments are passed, this just returns the cell contents.

Example
```scheme
> (define radix (make-parameter 10))
> (radix)
10
> (radix 2)
> (radix)
2

The top-level module for `glow-cli` is located in `cli/interaction.ss`

What is `define-multicall-main`?

It is called `make-parameter`, because the associated variable is dynamically bound!

Reference: https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html

Also note:
This is not thread safe for gambit according to be above srfi? 

Q: What's the point though?
Can't we just do `set!` against a variable, doesn't that accomplish the same thing? 
A: This is for `dynamic` variables.


### define-multicall-main

First let's decrypt what is a [[d223d1a2]].
Next we can see we define a `main` entrypoint,
which is multicall, `gxi` uses this to know the program entrypoint.
Based on that this uses `call-entrypoint` which calls `call-entrypoint/internal`.
This then gets the entrypoints by the `command`, i.e. the first argument.
It then calls that command.

Next, we observe in `cli/interaction.ss`, and other places we use
`define-entry-point` to start an interaction.

## What do we use to construct our CLI parser?

We use `gerbil-poo/cli` which uses `getopt`.

## How does `gerbil-poo/cli` work?

Its interface is located in `gerbil-poo/cli`.
It uses `make-options`
