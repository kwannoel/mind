# Atomics

## The basic idea

In a normal scenario where 2 different threads operate on the same value, something like this may happen:

```
x = 0

// Thread 1
x = 1

// Thread 2
cout << x << endl;
```

Suppose Thread 1 goes first, then Thread 2.
Then we expect to get 1 printed, with x = 1 at the end.

However, it is not guaranteed that `x = 1` compiles to one instruction, this depends on the architecture (e.g. 64-bit instructions might become 2 32-bit instructions on 32 bit platforms).
OR even that the instructions execute atomically on the processor (e.g. ARMv7 - STRD instruction).

As a result, instruction from thread 2 could run while instruction from thread 1 is mid-way.
This will corrupt the read result from thread 2.

To avoid these behaviours we use atomics. They ensure that mid-way while either instruction occurs, no other conflicting instruction can intervene (unless they are both reads of course).

## More goodies

This form of synchronization follows the rule of [[81ea56b9]] 
Instructions interleave in some sequence.
Whatever this sequence is, all threads have to agree on.

See [[bdc55a1d]] for more strategies we can choose.
