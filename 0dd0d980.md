# Semaphore interface

Semaphore is an interface to generally describe synchronization mechanism.
This means it can have different implementations.

It Provides **A way to block a no. of processes (sleep)**, 
**A way to unblock / wakeup > 1 or more sleeping process.**
  
## Interface

S is a semaphore.

We have 2 functions which interact with it.

### Wait(S)

1. **Conditional** if S <= 0, blocks (go to sleep), until it is more than 0 than we release.
2. **Decrement S**

### Signal(S) / Up(S) / v(S)

1. **Increments S**
2. Wakes up 1 sleeping process if any
3. This operation never blocks

Reminder: The above specifies the behaviour, not the implementation.
