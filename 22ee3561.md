# What is quasi-quote?

[quasi-quote vs quote](https://gist.github.com/kwannoel/ffd05b1c53469ade10da6ab4af555c0b)

Suppose we have the following declaration:

```
food = burger
Eat food
```

Intuitively we can guess we wanted to say:

```
Eat burger
```

However, we can't say for sure, since `Eat food` is ambiguous, we are not sure whether to treat the whole thing literally or evaluate underlying meanings.

As such we wrap the whole thing in a `quasi-quote`. This tells us to just take everything literally.

```
`(Eat food) ; equivalent to `(quasi-quote (Eat food))`
```

Next, we mark the parts we want to evaluate, in this case `food`.

```
`(Eat ,food)
```
