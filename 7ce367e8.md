# Dynamic scoping is useful

Suppose parent thread spawns some child threads.

If parent thread exits, without terminating child thread,
child thread might run indefinitely.

Is there a way to ensure if parent thread exits, child thread also exits?

In languages with dynamic scoping you can do so,
since the scope in which a thread is spawned, is dynamic.
This means that you can say if parent thread exits,
kill child thread also.
