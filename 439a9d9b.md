# Cache block size trade offs

Average access time = hit rate x hit time + 1-hit rate x miss penalty

Larger block size:

- Takes advantage of spatial locality

- Larger miss penalty: Takes longer time to fill up the block

- If block size is too big relative to cache size

  Too few cache block -> miss rate will increase
