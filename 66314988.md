# Emergence

Not a property of any component of the system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole.

# Definitions

# Weak emergence
Can simulate
Similar forms of after the fact analysis

# Strong emergence
High level -> components. Qualities of such a system is irreducible to it's constituent parts.

Interesting simulations:
- Include implicit side effects in interacting objects in a system
  These modifications to other objects should be subtle.
