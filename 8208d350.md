# peer to peer networking (p2p networks)

In contrast to server-client networks,
we have peer to peer networks,
where node identities are homogeneous,
although they can have different roles.

## What are the tradeoffs?

- Data probably has to be decentralized
  If it is stored in one source, that source will be a bottleneck.
  This is not as straightforward as just storing in server.

## What are the advantages?

- Cost is divided among peers
  - For server-client the costs are usually borne by the server provider.
