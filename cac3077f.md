# CPU Execution Time

CPU Time = Seconds / Program (time taken to execute each program)

CPU Time = (Cycle / Program) * (Seconds / Cycle) (how many cycles, how long do these cycles take)

CPU Time = (Instructions / Program) * (Cycles / Instruction) * (Seconds / Cycle)

Cycles / Instruction := <24b81838>
