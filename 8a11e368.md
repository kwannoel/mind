Suppose we have a function that requires knowing the environment

```hs
start :: Env -> ...
```

It will be pretty common to require this throughout the code.

```hs
startLogger :: Env -> ...
startDatabase :: Env -> ...
```

Considering that we only need read access to the environment, we can use the reader monad

```hs
data Reader r a = Reader (r -> a)

instance Monad (Reader r) where
    return a = ReaderG $ \_ -> a
    (>>=) :: (r -> a) -> (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> b)
    ReaderG f >>= g = ReaderG $ \r -> let a = f r
                                          f' = g a
                                       in f' r
```

Observe that the variable `r` passed into both functions `f`, `f'` is the same.

This shows that we reuse the same `r` value, which could be the environment, a configuration and so on.

This is used as a READ-only value. We cannot update it, as again `(>>=)` only gives us `a`.

This allows us to do things like the following
```hs
-- Get environment
ask :: Reader r r

-- Modify local environment
local :: (r -> r) -> Reader r a -> Reader r a

main :: Reader r r
main = do
  r <- ask -- ^ Access to the `r` value
  return r
  
-- equivalent to 
main2 :: Reader r r
main2 = ask >>= \r -> return r -- ^ return expanded here for similarity with main
```

What if we want both `READ/WRITE`?

We can use the [[370e62ed]] which combines the ideas of the `Reader` and `Writer` monads
