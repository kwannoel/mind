# Types as axioms

Takeaway:

In Haskell when we want to represent an even list what comes to mind is activating some sort of language extension to add some constraints.

This perspective is *restrictive*. 

Where we want to restrict our original definition of a `List` somehow:
```
-- We want to constraint this
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

However, another perspective we can adopt is constructive.

We first look at the definition of a list on two ways:

1) The axiom

    The empty list is a list
    
2) The inference rule

    If you have a list, and you add an element to the beginning, the result is also a list
    
Such an approach is constructive, we think of the axioms and inference rules to construct the datatype.

We can have the following axioms for an even list:

1) The axiom

    The even list is a list
    
2) The inference rule

    If you have a list, and you add *two* element to the beginning, the result is also an even list
    
Hence we will define our list as such:
```
data EvenList a = Nil | Cons a a (List a)
```
