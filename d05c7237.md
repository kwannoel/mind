# Producer consumer: Blocking

Use 3 mutex:

```
mutex = S(1)
notFull = S(K)
notEmpty = S(0)
```

We replace busy waiting here, with the `notFull` and `notEmpty` mutexes.

These will simply send a process to sleep, if the conditions do not hold:
1. Producer: Buffer not full
2. Consumer: Buffer not empty

so the process does not do busy waiting!

How do we continue on the process that when to sleep?

Recall that `signal` wakes up sleeping processes.
This will cause the sleeping process to wake up.
