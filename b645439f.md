# Semaphore invariant

Given that:
```
S_initial >= 0
```

Invariant:
```
S_current = S_initial + #signal(S) - #wait(S)
```

#signal(S) -> no of `signal()` operations executed on `S`
#wait(S) -> no of `wait()` operations completed on `S`

This is because each `signal` call always increments S by 1, `wait` call always decrements by 1.
