# My First Kernel Module: A Debugging Nightmare

[Original article](https://reberhardt.com/blog/2020/11/18/my-first-kernel-module.html#a-nightmare-begins)

## Takeaways

### Problem 1

2 threads want to access a piece of data. If one thread modifies data at same time as another thread READs it, we encounter [[6ec14b0d]] .

#### Easy solution

[[2775e248]] or [[cc1e991d]] 

Use [[3193da6a]] 

#### Harder solution

We use [[24be9b3e]].

The bug was caused due to indicating threads were free. Due to [[71c5b37a]] and other functions. Then we tried to access the old copy. However it had already been freed.
