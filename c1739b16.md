# How do we decide if compilation is correct?

Language standards for semantics.

E.g. K Framework

See Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers - property checking for C programs.
Proving compilers correct.
CompCert, written in Coq
Verified Software Toolchain,
Vellvm

## Conretely how do we capture correctness

P0 in C
P1 in asm

Result(P, input) = Rc Rx86 = Result(compile(P), input)

= here refers to semantics

For any program P and any input
interpreting P with input in C.
is the same as executing compilation of P with input in x86 assembly.

forall P, input: *interpret*(P, input) = *execute*(compile(P), input)

italics are assumed correct.
