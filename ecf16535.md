# What problems is Casper / highway solving?

## Context

Lots of progress in designing efficient <c0dc4bcc>.

In Classical models finality is binary.
Problem because nodes have wrong incentives.
Out of many blocks, only 1 is the final one.

In highway model is expressed by fraction of nodes needed to break protocol rules for a block to be reverted.

## Flexibility

Nodes can configure their security thresholds,
allowing those with lower threshold to reach finality faster 
than the ones requiring higher levels of confidence.
