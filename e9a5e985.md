# Finding my public IP

Usually you can find this on your router's homepage,
which you access by: [[e65709a4]] .

Otherwise you could also send a packet to a remote service,
the remote service could capture the ip on your behalf.

E.g. https://whatsmyapp.com

See: [[31d60cd6]], this may or may not be supported depending on

Q: Is it possible to specify a traversal such that your packet goes to router, and routes back to you?
then fetch the public ip from there?
