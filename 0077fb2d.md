# Things which compound (for me)

- Understanding the best way I absorb information #

  Problem solving approach - Rather than reading text, I enjoy going straight to exercises and solving these.
  Should take this to the next step, focusing on decomposing the extremely tough problems into smaller ones.
  
- Sharing information with others ##

  After I share information, questions are asked, and people share related things
  
- Analytical reading

- Investing #

  Slowly making progress here. Should start doing dollar cost averaging
  
- Budgeting

  No progress here yet.

- Reflection

  Concretize the improvements I need to make and am making.
  Make sure I am doing things which are **important** to my personal growth.
  
- Meditation

  Only did one session and gave up. Should do this more often.
  
- Exercise

  No explanation needed here..
  
- Communication

  This is a recent addition, something which I have known was important for a long time.
  When working in teams you **have** to be good at this. Either asking right qns / giving clear ans.

  
Those with '#'s are things I believe I have been practicing.

This list will evolve over time to track my personal progress.
