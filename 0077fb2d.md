# Things which compound (for me)

- Understanding the best way I absorb information #
  Problem solving approach - Rather than reading text, I enjoy going straight to exercises and solving these.
  Should take this to the next step, focusing on decomposing the extremely tough problems into smaller ones.
  
- Sharing information with others ##
  After I share information, questions are asked, and people share related things
  
- Analytical reading

- Investing #
  Slowly making progress here. Should start doing dollar cost averaging
  
- Budgeting
  No progress here yet.

- Reflection
  Concretize the improvements I need to make and am making.
  Make sure I am doing things which are **important**

Those with '#'s are things I believe I have been practicing.
