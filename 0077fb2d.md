# Things which compound

- Being purposeful #

  Understand my motivations.
  
- Remove ambuity

  Decision making causes strain.
  
  Removing ambuity allows us specify precise actions to get things done.
  
  This removes a layer of stress.
  
- Doing hard things #

  Become disciplined.

- Understanding my motivations

  I am motivated by solving problems:
  For learning: Rather than reading text, I enjoy going straight to exercises and solving these.
  Alternatively I formulate questions and answer them.
  
  In terms of work I am motivated by solving **important** problems other people face.
  
- Applying problem solving approach to myself

  Problem solving skills:
  - decomposing problems into first principles
  - rubber ducking
  - getting advice
  - writing
  
  Should not just be applied to work, should be applied to all aspects of life.

- Sharing information with others #

  After I share information, questions are asked, and people share related things.
  
- Analytical reading

  Need to be critical about sources. After all I have a new superpower: digging into data.

- Investing #

  Opened an account

- Budgeting

  No progress here yet.
  
  Update: My expenses have been consistently low,
  probably because the pandemic has kept me at home.

- Reflection

  Concretize the improvements I need to make and am making.
  Make sure I am doing things which are **important** to my personal growth.
  
- Meditation

  This gives me emotional stability and clarity of thought.

  Only did one session and gave up. Should do this more often.
  
- Exercise

  As above.
  
- Communication #

  This is a recent addition, something which I have known was important for a long time.
  When working in teams you **have** to be good at this. Either asking right qns / giving clear ans.
  
  Have been regularly asking for feedback at work.
  
  I think I need to scale this to other aspects of life as well.
  
Those with '#'s are things I believe I have been practicing.

This list will evolve over time to track my personal progress.
