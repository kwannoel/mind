# stop word / stop list

Excludes common words which have little semantic value.

Moving away from this:

- Good compression techniques.
- Good query optimization techniques.
- bad for phrase queries: King of Denmark
- bad for song titles: Let it be
- bad for relational queries: "flights to London"
