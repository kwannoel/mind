I have been thinking about dropping out to pursue a full-time job for a while now.

After asking for some advice, I had some insight regarding this.

### Pros

- You make more money

- Industry experience

### Cons

- It will be **significantly harder** to emigrate if you wanted to without a degree

- You lose opportunity to work with professors on research topics

- Harder to network

- You learn certain things at school, much harder outside to learn these

  For example: learning about hardware, how computers work
