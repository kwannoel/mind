# MiniKanren run

`run` takes in 3 arguments.

`n` -> inclusive limit for number of results.
`q` -> What we bind the results to if **all** the goals succeed
`goals` -> A collection of goals.

`run*` is used to refer to run with unbounded `n`.

It returns a goal:
Either success (`true`) or failure (`false`).

# Examples

`q` is associated with `#t` here, since all other goals (`#s`) succeed.
``` elisp
(run* (q)
  #s
  (== #t q))
```

r is associated with `corn`, (`corn` here is a value)
```elisp
(run* (q)
  #s
  (== corn q))
```
