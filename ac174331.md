# Circuit switching

e2e resources reserved for "call" between source & dest.

dedicated resources: no sharing

- circuit-like perf
  - no queueing delays
  - no packet drops
  
- If resource is reserved, you cannot use it :(

- however circuit segment idle if not used by call

commonly used in traditional telephone networks
