- Substituability
  [[abc970ad]]
  Treat objects of different types as one type.

- Overriding
  [[af4b1218]] 
  Permits different (polymorphic) behaviors in response to same method call.

- Dynamic binding
  [[9b265b15]]
  Polymorphic code can call method of parent class, execute implementation of child class
