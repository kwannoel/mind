# Making slides from markdown

Making slides should be straightforward.
Even w3schools has a tutorial on it: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp

There are existing solutions, which generate slides, and I have enjoyed using them.

However, I'd like a tool with lightweight dependencies, with target as web-based.

Usage should be something like speedscope, just need to upload my markdown file, get my slides hosted statically on the site.
