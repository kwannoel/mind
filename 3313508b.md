# Plutus components

Plutus is a DApp language, with on-chain and off-chain code.

## On-chain - Plutus Tx, Plutus Core

[[b782c0a0]]

```
PlutusTx -> PlutusCore (Lambda calculus assembly lang)
```

## Off-chain - Plutus Application Backend (PAB)

Client-side runtime.

### HTTP, websocket interface for interacting with Contract instances.

PAB operations (start new instances, call instance endpoints, query instance state)
are performed with this interface.

### Chain index database

Queries served over HTTP API.

Store data from Cardano transactions.
Uses [[bcf78c8e]] .
Needs to be co-located with Cardano node.
Read-only, can be shared between PABs.

Expressiveness between node which answers queries related to ledger state, and `db-sync`, which has full history of all transactions, and an expressive database schema for staking and other info.

### Alonzo node

PAB subscribes to ledger state updates from the node, using a socket protocol.

### Wallet

[[188e968d]]

Signing transactions
