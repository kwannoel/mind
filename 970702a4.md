# What is PlutusTx.Validator?


In [plutus core specification](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5988492/download/1/plutus-core-specification.pdf),
they have the `(error A)` which is used to terminate computation.

Otherwise the unit type: `()` is returned, which means everything went fine.

TODO: Get plutus core dump from error scripts with custom error messages, run these.
