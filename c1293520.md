# Building cpp projects with Nixos

Collection of more obscure information.

When developing on Nixos, use:
```
llvmPackages_13.libcxxClang
```

Because
```
clang_13
```

Does not have `libc++`.

When creating a `shell.nix`,
also use `stdenvNoCC` otherwise the environment has a `gcc` default which you don't want:
```
stdenvNoCC.mkDerivation {
  name = "asd";
  buildInputs = [
    # clang_13
    llvmPackages_13.libcxxClang # the other one doesn't have libcxxClang
    gdb
  ];
}
```
