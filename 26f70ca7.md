# Assignment for mutable records

First, we understand that records are **partial functions: properties -> location**

## Semantic domain extension

Include bottom in the event we access an undefined record attribute.

## As arguments to functions

1. <0ce2d8de> states that we should allocate a new location in the store for the record.
2. However, the *locations* still refer to the original locations.

**Behaviour when properties reassigned**
```
a = {'a': 1}

function f(o) {
  o.a = 2;
}

f(a)
a // {'a': 2}
```

**Behaviour when object reassigned**
```
a = {'a': 1}

function f(o) {
  a = 2; // different location instantiated for a, original a is not modified.
}

f(a)
a // {'a': 1}
```
