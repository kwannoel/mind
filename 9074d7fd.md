# MIPS Delayed branching

Do something useful while waiting for the outcome

## Solution

Move **non-control dependent instructions** into the X slots following a branch

Known as the branch-delay slot.

These instructions are executed regardless of branch outcome.


### Best case

There is an instruction which can be moved

### Worst case

Instruction cannot be found.

Add no-op (nop) instruciton in the branch-delay slot slot
