### Conversion
positive value - no change
E.g. 00001100

negative value, X - 2^n - X - 1
E.g. -00001100
Under 8-bit 1s-complement:
2^8 - 12 - 1 = 243 = 11110011

Invert the bits to get the complement

### Properties
If MSB is 1, it is negative

Full 0s and 1s are positive and negative 0s respectively:
0000 = +0
1111 = -0

### Operations
Binary addition
1. Binary add 2 numbers
2. If there is carry out of MSB, it is said to be wrapped around
  That bit gets added to the LSB instead of in-front:
  1 0111 becomes 0111 + 0001 = 1000

3. Check for <9abdf910>.

Binary subtraction
1. Take 1s-complement of B
2. Binary addition: complement B + A
