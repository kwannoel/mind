# Refresh a tab on file update

Suppose we have a file: `index.html`.

We serve it on `localhost:3000` and view it through the browser.

In development, changes to the `index.html` file do not trigger a refresh on the browser.

Only [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) / [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) seem to have this functionality. It seems foolish however, if we are just dealing with small static sites to pull in these tools and all their dependencies.

## Solution

```
service --[watches]--> index.html

server ----[serves]---> index.html

server <--[Updates]--- service
|
----------[Updates]--> Browser webpage
```

## Service

- Watch index.html

  [`inotify`](https://superuser.com/questions/181517/how-to-execute-a-command-whenever-a-file-changes)
  
- Update server

  Send a request to a server endpoint
  
## Server

- Handle updates

  Handle incoming request from service

  Send update via websocket to client
  
## Client

- How to refresh a page programmatically

  [Open a websocket connection with server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)
  
  Listen to incoming message from server
