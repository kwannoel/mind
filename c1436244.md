### Conversion
positive value - no change
E.g. 00001100

negative value, X - 2^n
E.g. -00001100
Under 8-bit 1s-complement:
2^8 - 12 = 244 = 11110100

Invert the bits to get the complement

**HACK**
Convert using 1s bit-flipping, add-1

### Properties
If MSB is 1, it is negative

If MSB is 0, it is either 0 (000) or positive

Full 0s and 1s are positive and negative 0s respectively:
0000 = +0
1111 = -0

### Operations
Binary addition
1. Binary add 2 numbers
2. Ignore carry out of MSB
3. Check for <9abdf910>.

Binary subtraction
1. Take 2s-complement of B
2. Binary addition: complement B + A
