# What are free names?

Suppose we have the following expression:

```
(x => { return 4 * square(x) })(3)
```

`square` is free. This is because **it is not declared by the immediate surrounding function**

## Concrete representation

We can map expressions to their free variables through means of a relation: `><`

## Examples

`symbols`
```
x >< {x}
```

`numbers`
```
n >< {}
```

## More complex examples

Predicates
```
E1 >< X1  E2 >< X2  E3 >< X3
----------------------------
E1 ? E2 : E3 >< X1 ∪ X2 ∪ X3
```

function
```
S >< X
----------------------
(x1, ..., xn) a=> { S } >< X - {x1,...,xn}
```
