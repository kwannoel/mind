I've wanted a Window Manager for OSX for a while now. I've previously used xmonad and was looking for something with similar UX.

I tried [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectanglehttps://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) but it only supported window snapping.

Eventually I came across [amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) which allowed me to toggle workspaces similar to xmonad. Biggest draw for me was/is multi-screen toggling.
