# MicroKernel OS

Small and clean

Basic and essential facilities
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Address space management
- Thread management

Higher level services:
- Built on top of the basic facilities
- Run as a server process outside of the OS
- Use IPC to communicate

Advantages:
- Kernel more robust and extendible
- Better isolation and protection between kernel and high level services

Disadvantages:
- Lower performance
