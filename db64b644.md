# Libp2p stream multiplexing

https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/

What is [[355b70c3]]

## Why do we need multiplexing?

If we communicate frequently with a peer,
we'd like to avoid establishing new transport connections.
This is because creating new transport connections
might involve [[31d60cd6]] traversals, which are expensive.

Multiplexing allows us to have concurrent streams which use the same transport connection.

## Which layer should we do multiplexing though?

Multiplexing is done at the application layer for greater portability.

## Can it scale?

Yes, we can swap out multiplexing protocols according to our needs.

For instance [yamux](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux) allows
us to scale to thousands of multiplexed streams over a single connection.
