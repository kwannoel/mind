# Relaxed Ordering

No synchronizes-with.

same thread obey happens-before.

Inter thread obey modification order - if you just wrote, and you perform a read, you may get back
the value you wrote, or a value further down from another thread.

Analogy from "C++ Concurrency in Action":
```
To understand how this works, imagine that each variable is a man in a cubicle with a
notepad. On his notepad is a list of values. You can phone him and ask him to give you
a value, or you can tell him to write down a new value. If you tell him to write down a
new value, he writes it at the bottom of the list. If you ask him for a value, he reads you
a number from the list.
The first time you talk to this man, if you ask him for a value, he may give you any
value from the list he has on his pad at the time. If you then ask him for another value,
he may give you the same one again or a value from farther down the list. He’ll never
give you a value from farther up the list. If you tell him to write down a number and
then subsequently ask him for a value, he’ll give you either the number you told him
to write down or a number below that on the list.
Imagine for a moment that his list starts with the values 5, 10, 23, 3, 1, and 2. If you
ask for a value, you could get any of those. If he gives you 10, then the next time you ask
he could give you 10 again, or any of the later ones, but not 5. If you call him five
times, he could say “10, 10, 1, 2, 2,” for example. If you tell him to write down 42, he’ll
add it to the end of the list. If you ask him for a number again, he’ll keep telling you
“42” until he has another number on his list and he feels like telling it to you.
Now, imagine your friend Carl also has this man’s number. Carl can also phone
him and either ask him to write down a number or ask for one, and he applies the
same rules to Carl as he does to you. He has only one phone, so he can only deal with
one of you at a time, so the list on his pad is a nice straightforward list. But just
because you got him to write down a new number doesn’t mean he has to tell it to
Carl, and vice versa. If Carl asked him for a number and was told “23,” then just
because you asked the man to write down 42 doesn’t mean he’ll tell that to Carl next
time. He may tell Carl any of the numbers 23, 3, 1, 2, 42, or even the 67 that Fred told
him to write down after you called. He could very well tell Carl “23, 3, 3, 1, 67” without
being inconsistent with what he told you. It’s like he keeps track of which number he
told to whom with a little moveable sticky note for each person, like in figure 5.5.
