# How can we rank search results?

We store frequency as well in our table:

| Term  | Doc_id | Freq | Postings |
|-------|--------|------|----------|
| "asd" | 1      | 3    | 0, 5, 10 |
| "sss" | 1      | 2    | 1, 2     |

As you can see, "asd" appears 3 times: "0, 5, 10" in document 1. Hence we say it appears 3 times (Freq = 3)

It has higher ranking than "sss" overall in the same document, since it appears thrice, whereas "sss" appears twice.
