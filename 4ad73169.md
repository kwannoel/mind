# Technical analysis of blockchains [WIP]

## Motivations

Many journal articles on blockchains merely talk about their behaviour on a surface level, rather than on a deeper, technical level.

Here we want to look deeper and understand technical details, since these provide fundamental proofs whether a claim is true or not.

This is inspired by [Stephen Diehl's posts]() on blockchain, especially him mentioning there was little technical journalism on blockchain.

Given this is a domain I'm relatively new to, I welcome objective criticism and recommendations for resources for further exploration.
