# Notes on Glow's language model

Supports consensual asset control. This means that there is an extra participant who manages the collect assets of participants.

The behaviour of the consensus will:
1. Verify computations of all participants to see if they are valid.
2. Transfer assets if and only if 1. holds and they are directed to do so.

Blocks of execution are separated into 2:
1. local blocks executed by participants themselves
2. Consensus blocks

Consensus blocks are code that:
- ran in participant clients / for monitoring the dapp's computations.
- on chain code
