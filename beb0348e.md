# LSM Tree

## Motivations

Doing lots of disk writes in expensive (disk i/o). We batch writes by using in memory buffers to accumulate,
and write in one-shot.

Has two components:
- C1: In memory buffers (small)
- C2: On disk (larger)

We merge in memory segments into disk.

## Design

Make inserts and deletes cheap (disk writes).

LSM Trees cascade data from incoming stream into smaller, higher performing stores.

## Merging algorithm a.k.a rolling merge

This is heart of LSM algorithm. It migrate entries from C0 to C1, C1 to C2, ..., to free buffer space.

Removes a contiguous segment of entries from c0 to c1.

C0 - Memtable
C1 Tree - SSTable.

Helps with compaction.

## Recovery

Store instructions in log, can use for recovery.

## Tradeoffs

Disk i/o not cheap.

## Further questions

Will B+Tree augmented with memory be able to support the same thing?
