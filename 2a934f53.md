# combining biword and positional indices

[next word index](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.6254&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Record words that follow a given word.

A typical web query mixture was executed in 1/4 of the time of using just a positional index.

Required 26% more space over just having a positional index.

It is inefficient to merge positional postings lists for biwords which are queried often.

E.g. "Michael Jackson" / "Britney Spears".
