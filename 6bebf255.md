# What is applicative?

It is Monoidal functor:
```hs
class Functor f => Monoidal f where
  unit :: f ()
  (**) :: f a -> f b -> f (a,b)
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  
-- The two operators are equivalent:
f <*> a = apply <$> f ** a
  where apply (f, a) = f a
  
a ** b = (,) <$> b <*> a
```

| Law           | Proof                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Naturality    | fmap (f *** g) (u ** v) = fmap f u ** fmap g v |
| Left id       | unit ** v ≝ v                                  |
| Right id      | u ** unit ≝ u                                  |
| Associativity | u ** (v ** w) ≝                                |

Notes:

```hs
(***) :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> (a, c) -> (b, d)
f *** g = \(x,y) -> (f x, g y)
```

`≝` refers to isomorphic - f ((), a) is isomorphic to f a.

What is naturality?

It says that if I combine the contexts of 2 applicative functors, then apply functions to the result values

It should be the same as me applying functions to each applicative, then combining them.

# Examples of Invalid naturality

Highly contrived example..

Assume monoidal instance for Int, with 1 and (+) as empty and (<>).
```hs
fmap _ (Right _) = Left empty
```

```hs
fmap f (Right 2 ** Left 1) = fmap f Left 1
                           = Left 1
fmap f (Right 2) ** fmap g (Left 1) = Left 1 ** Left 1
                                    = Left 2
```
