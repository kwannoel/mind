# Tower of Hanoi

### Rules

1. Only one disc can be moved at a time
2. Each move consist of taking the *top* disc of one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack / rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on a smaller disc.

### Recursive solution
```
def hanoi(n, 1, 3, 2) // Move n disks from rod 1 - 3 using rod 2
if n > 0
  hanoi(n - 1, 2, 3)
  move disk n from rod 1 -> rod 3
  hanoi(n - 1, 2, 3, 1)

```

### Lower bounds

Let the lower bound be some $S(n)$.

Consider two scenarios:

- What happened before disk `n` (relative position from top of a stack) is moved to the last rod 3

  We have to move n - 1 discs on top of the nth disk first.
  
  T(n - 1)

- What happened to move n disk on to rod 3
   
  We have to move n - 1 discs to the rod 3.
  
  T(n - 1)
 
Therefore we prove the minimum runtime,

T(0) = 0
T(n) = 2T(n - 1) + 1
