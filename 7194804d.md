# NP-Complete

Every other problem in NP must be able to be transformed (in polynomial time) to this problem.

Lies in the intersection between NP-hard and NP.

## What's the point?

1. We want to unify all NP Hard problems such that if we solve one of them, we solve the rest as well!
  a. Provide a framework, for the parts we are unsure about, use wishful thinking and leave it as a hole
     That way, we can focus on the *holes* which are the essence of the problem

2. We want to solve NP Hard problems in polynomial time
  a. solve the holes

## How do we prove it?

We are trying to show it lies in the intersection between [[f7a32de0]]  and [[26d377d7]] .

1. Show it is in [[26d377d7]]  (show a satisfiable answer can be verified in polynomial time).

2. Take a known NP-Complete problem, e.g. 3-SAT and reduce it to our problem, L.

    If we can do this in polynomial time, all problems can be reduced to L in polynomial time
