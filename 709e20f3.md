# What is the difference between UTXO and EUTXO?

In UTXO we have **public key addresses**.

**public key addresses are derived from owner's public key**

Next, if a signature belonging to that public key is included in the transaction 
(i.e. it was signed by the current owner's private key),
this means it can be consumed.

In EUTXO we also have **script addresses**.

When a transaction wants to consume a UTXO sitting at a script address,
it will run the script and depending on the result of the script,
decide whether transaction is valid.

There are 2 more additions:
1. Instead of signing such transactions, we have redeemers
2. On the output we also have Datum, not just the new UTXO.
3. We also have context - the transaction being validated, including its inputs and outputs.
