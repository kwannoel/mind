# Literate programming

Old school is graph like!

TeX the Program

https://wiki.c2.com/?TexTheProgram

Making organization more efficient

Risk team

Legal team, word files / html files - parsing?

examples of tools built?

design process?

What do you mean: English -> move them towards something more formal

Do people ask you to solve their problems?
What problems are these?

Ops team 
- trader 
- currently done with spreadsheets?
- solution first?
  - provide them solutions
- pricing stack

Problem James faces:
- People have idea of how things should be done (~30 years).
- They don't know what's possible
- We have a vision of what's possible.
  - Execute that onto day to day reality.
  - Highly iterative.
    - Ambiguous

- Gradual typing system
- Creating documentation which is legally valid
- Codegen documentation
- Codegen Org charts
- Autogen org chart
