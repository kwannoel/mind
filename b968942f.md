# naive Critical section implementation

## Naive attempt 1

Have a register: Lock

```c
while (Lock != 0); // poll for lock = 0
Lock = 1; // acquire lock

critical_section();

Lock = 0; // release
```

However, 2 processes can access a Lock at the same time!

We have a scenario where p1, p2 access Lock, see it is 0.
They both then proceed to update Lock = 1.
and access the critical section together.

This is incorrect and violates the <a501c808> principle, since only 1 process should access critical section at once.

## Naive attempt 2

Have a register: `Turn = 0`

`Process A`
```c
while (Turn != 0); // Turn = 0, acquire
critical_section();
Turn = 1;
```

`Process B`
```c
while (Turn != 1); // Turn = 1, acquire
critical_section();
Turn = 0;
```

Now even if they accessed Turn at the same time, because each have a specific value of turn, only 1 process will gain access.

Assumption:
- A & B executes the above in loop
- Take turn to enter critical section

Problems:
- Starvation:
  if A never runs, it never enters CS, it also never updates Turn. So B starves

- Violates the <e7bdfb0f> 

## Naive attempt 3

Have 2 registers: I, J

`Process A`
```c
I = 1;
while(J);
critical_section();
J = 0;
```

`Process B`
```c
J = 1;
while(I);
critical_section();
I = 0;
```

Now, we have 2 slots. When we want to access a resource we do 2 things:

1. Update the register assigned to us
2. Continue if the register for the other process indicates it is done

Now, in the scenario that A does not trigger, B still gets cleared:

Register I (assigned to A) = 0
So B is able to continue on executing.

However, we can still have a deadlock!

Both A, B enter:

They update their respective registers => `I = 1, J = 1`

Then both of them get stuck:

A
```
while(J)
```

B
```
while(I)
```

Previously we used Turn (in naive attempt 2), to ensure that although 2 processes might access concurrently,
only one can trigger when **acquiring** a lock.

The current solution works well, with the only shortfall of **both acquiring a lock**.

It solves the problem of just **turn** above, since we do not have to wait for a specific process to kickstart.
