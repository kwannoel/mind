# tldr of a tldr: select, poll, epoll from Julia Evans

Reference: https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/

This is a summary of Julia Evans blogpost above^. Please visit the original link for a better explanation.

## What we want

Instead of pinging kernel nonstop to ask for updates, we want the kernel to tell us when there are updates.

## Polling

`poll` and `select` call the kernel to tell us with a polling mechanism.
The kernel doesn't remember which file descriptors to monitor,
it only knows because we tell it,
bypassing the file descriptors in the arguments.
This takes time.

## Terminology

- level-triggered

## Signal Driven I/O

`signal-driven I/O` - idk

## epoll

- epoll_create - tell kernel u wanna epoll
 
- epoll_ctl - tell kernel which fd u want updates from.
  NOTE: this works for everything except regular files: e.g. sockets, pipes, FIFOs, POSIX msg queues, etc...
  
- epoll_wait - wait for updates

## Performance


In the book: [The Linux Programming Interface](https://www.bookdepository.com/Linux-Programming-Interface-Michael-Kerrisk/9781593272203#), thereâ€™s a table comparing the performance for 100,000 monitoring operations:

```
  operations  |  poll  |  select   | epoll
10            |   0.61 |    0.73   | 0.41
100           |   2.9  |    3.0    | 0.42
1000          |  35    |   35      | 0.53
10000         | 990    |  930      | 0.66
```
