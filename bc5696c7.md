# Relative frequency

"a" be number of times event A has occurred among the n reptitions, a / n is relative frequency.

$f_{A} = \frac{n_{A}}{n}$

$f_{A}$ = 1 iff A occurs every time among n repetitions.

$f_{A}$ = 0 iff A does not occur at all.

As experiment is repeated more times, $f_{A}$ stabilizes.
