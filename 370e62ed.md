Do checkout [[8a11e368]] and [[2af0d82f]] before reading this for context.

Earlier on we encountered the Reader and Writer Monads both of which offered some part of functionality we wanted.

Combining ideas from these gives us the State Monad

```hs
data State s a = State (s -> (a, s))

instance Monad (State s) where
  return a = State $ \s -> (a, s)
  State st >>= f = State $ \s -> let (a, s2) = st s
                                     State st2 = f a
                                 in  st2 s2
```

This gives us the following operations
```hs
-- Leaves state unchanged, result is set to state
get :: State s s
get = State $ \s -> (s, s)

-- Sets result to () and updates state
put :: s -> State s ()
put x = State $ \s -> ((), x)

-- Modifies state
modify :: (s -> s) -> State s ()
modify f = State $ \s -> ((), f s)
```
