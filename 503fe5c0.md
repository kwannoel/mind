# GHC profiling

Referenced from: [GHC User's guide](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html)

## Steps

1. Recompile program with `-prof`. (Automate with `-fprof-auto`).

    Uses [[40a48e4d]] to determine time / space costs.

2. Generate profile `prog.prof`, by adding `+RTS -p` while executing binary.

3. Examine profiled info, use to optimize program.
