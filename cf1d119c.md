# What if ACK / NAK is corrupted?

Receiver use checksum for sender to detect error.

sender still doesn't know what happened at receiver.

sender retransmits when receives garbled ACK -> packet is duplicated.

For NAK is does not matter (since we will retransmit anyways)

We can handle this using sequence bit.

If next packet incoming has already came, detect the duplicate.
