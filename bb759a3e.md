### How do hardware components work on the lowest level?

2 states: 1 | 0

### How do we express instructions and data?

We represent all these in binary, known as Machine Language / Object code

### How do we decide what languages to use?

Ease of expression for hardware ->
    Natural language, high level language, assembly language, machine language
<- Ease of expression for humans

### What are the tools used to convert languages to other languages?

- Translator 
  Accepts a program written in a *source language* -> *translates* it to a program in a *target language*

- Compiler 
  Standard name for a *translator* whose *source language* is a *high-level language*

- Interpreter 
  A translator that *translates & executes* a *source program*
  
### What processes does a high level compiled program go through to get executed on the machine?
- EDITOR
  Edit program -> 

- COMPILER SUITE (Compilation errors get thrown here)
  Compile to assembly -> Assemble to machine language ->
  link multiple machine language programs into one executable ->

- OS (Runtime errors, logic errors thrown here)
  load executable into computer memory -> Execute executable

Examples: Java, Haskell

### What processes does a interpreted program go through
- EDITOR
  Edit program ->
  
Per code statement:

- INTERPRETER
Compile, assemble, link -> Load, execute

Examples: Javascript, python

### What processes does a program on a VM go through?
- EDITOR
  Edit program ->
  
- COMPILER
  Compile, assemble, link ->
  
- VM
  Load, execute ->
  
- OS
  Load, execute

### What processes does a C program go through?
Same as a compiled program

During compiling process we use gcc to compile, do linking and assemble to assembly
