# What is interval estimation?

It is a random interval, where we can determine probability of a random parameter existing.

e.g. x < y < z.

(x, z) is our interval estimation.

y is our unknown parameter.

# Example

Suppose we are given variance, we can then say that actual mean will lie in a range of values.
