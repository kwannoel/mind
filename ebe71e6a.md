# Editor optimization

I use `doom-emacs`, it is a nice balance between `emacs` and `spacemacs`. Does not require me to have many configurations to get productive, but at the same time does not include too many packages, only what I would probably use.

I can gradually learn and use various features included, as I encounter problems.

This page serves as a log of things I have happily discovered were already included and didn't need much configuration to setup.
