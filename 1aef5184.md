# Positional indexes

[[747fbaed]]

[Term]

| doc_id | Freq | Postings |
|--------|------|----------|
| 1      | 3    | 0, 5, 10 |
| 1      | 2    | 1, 2     |

Can do [[e7a86692]] 

## Disadvantages

Many positions e.g. SEC filings. -> 2-4x large than a non-positional index.

A positional index size is 35-50% of the volume of the original text.

Holds for all english-like languages.

Takes a longer time to merge, (a [[d3030857]] can perform the lookup instantaneously)

Need to look for the positions from the first word, merge all the documents in which both exist.
Then, need to merge the 2 lists O(min(m, n))
