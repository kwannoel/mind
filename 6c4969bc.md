### Decimal Repeated division by 2
| 2 | 43       |        |
| 2 | 21 rem 1 | <- LSB |
| 2 | 10 rem 1 |        |
| 2 | 5 rem 0  |        |
| 2 | 2 rem 1  |        |
| 2 | 1 rem 0  |        |
| 0 | rem 1    | <- MSB |

2nd column forms 101011.

### Fraction - repeated multiplication by 2
Carried digits produce answer: *1*.000 (1 is the carried digit here)

| 0.3125 * 2 = 0.625 | 0 |
| 0.625 * 2 = 1.25   | 1 |
| 0.25 * 2 = 0.50    | 0 |
| 0.5 * 2 = 1.00     | 1 |

( 0.3125 ) 10 = (.0101) 2

### Sum of weights
Determine set of binary weights whose sum == decimal number
9 = 8 + 1 = 1001
18 = 16 + 2 = 10010
58 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 111010
