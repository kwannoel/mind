# How to obtain frequency counts of a search term in search engine?

We use a generic word which appears everywhere "THE":

Then do `Count[word] / Count(THE)`

| Word       | Count          | Frequency            |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| The        | 25_270_000_000 | 1                    |
| Singapore  | 1_340_000_000  | 0.05302730510486743  |
| university | 1_540_000_000  | 0.060941828254847646 |
| national   | 4_880_000_000  | 0.19311436485951722  |
