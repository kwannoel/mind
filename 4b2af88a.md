# Software engineering design principles

## Fundamentals

Abstraction
Information Hiding (IH)
Cohesion, how well everything works with each other.
- signs that there's strong cohesion
  - easy to understand what other components are doing,
    how to interact with them
  - easy to name things
  - small tests, small classes, small methods
  - conceptual
    - what is the component responsible for?
  - spec
    - how is the component used by others
  - impl
    - how to impl functionality
Coupling
- how one part of a system affects another
- should be intentional.

## Principles

- SoC separation of concerns
- SRP single responsibility principle
- IS Interface segregation
- DI Dependency Inversion
- LSP Liskov Substitution principle
  - sub objects should be able to substitute parent without any issues.
- OCP open close principle
  - easy to extend, prevents modification.
  - Can change behaviour via interface, without going into internals.
- DRY
- Design to interface (d2i)
  Make it easy for people to understand and use your interface.
  that should be primary concern.
  
## Techniques

- decomposition, modularization, layering
- inheritance
- parameterization
- tabulation
