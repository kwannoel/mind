# Packet switching network

Move data in separate small blocks.

Each packet has a destination address.

When they are received, packets are reassembled in proper sequence to make up the message.

## Why is there a need for this vs circuit-switched networks?

From [[ac174331]] we observe a fair amount of waste.
This is because channels along the route are reserved as well,
even if the user is idle.

On the other hand, packet switching has the intermediate nodes forwarding packets,
continuously, so there's little waste, in terms of utilizing the intermediate nodes.

## Issues

- Network congestion, intermediate nodes could run out of space.
- Software bugs.
- Network hardware.
- Security Threats.
