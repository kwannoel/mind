Suppose we have a series of composed functions acting on a list

```hs
ls = unwords $ map show . map (+1) . filter (!== 0) $ [1..10000]
```

At each step of the way we need to build up intermediate lists:

1st list generated here
```hs
filter (!== 0) $ [1..10000]
```

2nd list generated here
```hs
map(+1) . filter (!== 0) $ [1..10000]
```

And so on.

As a result, we allocate 4 times when running the expression.

To optimize this,

We want to convert lists which are a recursive structure into a non-recursive costructure, [[4fa01aa6]] .

The reason is that filter, map and other common functions list functions are all recursive in nature.
This is a result of list being recursively defined, requiring us to recurse to traverse the list.

```hs
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter _ [] = []
filter pred (x:xs) | pred x = x : filter pred xs
                   | otherwise = filter pred xs
```

Hence these functions consume the entire list each time they are applied.

On the other hand, [[4fa01aa6]] functions are not recursive (since streams are not recursively defined).
Hence they not have to traverse the entire list:

```hs
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> Stream a -> Stream a
filter pred (Stream next st) = Stream next' st
  where
    next' s = case next s of
      Done -> Done
      Skip s' -> Skip s'
      Yield x s' | p x -> Yield x s'
                 | otherwise -> Skip s'
```
