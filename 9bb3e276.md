# peterson's algorithm

Registers:
Turn = 0
Want0 = 0
Want1 = 0

Process A
```c
Want0 = 1;
Turn = 1;
while(Want1 && Turn == 1) {
  critical_section();
}
Want0 = 0;
```

Process B
```c
Want1 = 1;
Turn = 0;
while(Want0 && Turn == 1) {
  critical_section();
}
Want1 = 0;
```

## Disadvantage

- <c458e794>:

  The waiting process repeatedly tests the while-loop condition, rather than going into blocked state.
  
- Low level implementation

  - Error-prone
  - Mutual exclusion needs to be simplified
  
- Too specific to 2 processes.

## Implementing this concretely
