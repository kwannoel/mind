## Arrays

How to represent arrays?
- static
  - array contains direct address
- dynamic
  - array contains indirect address

arrays are just collections of address pointers.

## Multi-dimensional arrays

We need to know the size of these.

OCaml, Java have a size of array,
during runtime (Waste more space).

```asm
movq -8(%rax) %rdx // load size, %rax is pointing at A[0] so we need to go back a word (-8).
cmpq %rdx %rcx // compare idx to bound
j l __ok // jump if ok
callq __err_oob

__ok:
  movq (%rax, %rcx, 8) dest
```

## Strings

C strings lie in text segment, so they are read only,
so they can be shared.

## Tagged Datatypes

Datatypes may be recursive,
in that case we can use pointer,
because it is known size.

In implementations which have length stored
allow us to have O(1) access.

## How to compile switch?

break instructions compiled to a jump to the next label after the switch blk.

```asm
%tag = ⟦e⟧
br label %l1
l1: %cmp1 = icmp eq %tag, $tag1
br %cmp1 label %b1, label %l
b1: ⟦s1⟧
br label %l2
l2: %cmp2 = icmp eq %tag, $tag2
br %cmp2 label %b2, label %l
b2: ⟦s2⟧
br label %l
lN: %cmpN = icmp eq %tag, $tagN
br %cmpN label %bN, label %merg
bN: ⟦sN⟧
br label %merg
merge:
```

## Pattern matching

Bind variables.
Patterns can nest.

Strategy:
- Flatten nested patterns into matches against one constructor at a time.
- Compile match against the tags of the datatype for C-style switches.
- Code for each branch must copy data from e to variables bound in the patterns.

## LLVM Datatypes

LLVM IR:
uses types to describe the structure of data.

```haskell
data t = void
       | i1 | i8 | i64 
       | [<#elts> x t]
       | fty
       | {t1, t2, ...}
       | t* (pointers)
       | %Tident (named type)
```

array types are monomorphic.

## Type Casting

## Regular Expressions

- ɛ, empty string
- 'a', ordinary character
- R1 | R2, alternatives, stands for choice of R1 or R2
- R1R2, concatenation, stands for R1, followed by R2.
- R*, Kleene star, stands for zero or more repetitions of R

## Extensions
- "foo", a string, requivalnet to 'f' 'o' 'o'
- R+, stands for one or more repetitions of R, equivalent to RR*
- R?, Zero or one occurrences of R, equivalent to (E|R)
- ['a'-'z'] One of a or b or c or ... z, equivalent to (a|b|...|z)
- [^'0'-'9'] Any char except 0 through 9 (expensive)
- R as x Name the string matched by R as x.
