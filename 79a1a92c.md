Q: How to tell if variable is live?
v is live is v is defined before the program point,
and used after it.

Q: What about types?

Q: The idea is about INFORMATION: Liveliness defines as supersets, subtyping is opposite.
   - Top is the one with MOST information.
   - Bottom with least.
     - e.g. Any is most pessimistic.

Q: Why got fixpoint?
Fixpoint function is when Fk(X) = Fk+1(X)
such that X is fixpoint of F.

Q: Why Haskell and OCaml more complicated?

A: Cannot tell statically the CFG - cause of lambda calculus encoding

Q: Doesn't haskell make if else a primitive?

Q: In some papers - convention is flipped lol, bottom is one with most info...

Note for hw6 we are using functors.
- Define the logic of analysis in the most abstract terms.
- 1. look at solver.
- neat -> combine
- partial order -> combine

Q: TA / research pos

- Any open source compiler work?
  - e.g. with ocaml?
  
- Verifying Silica in K-framework
- Resource analysis with smart contracts

~2s - ours
-0.892s - clang

- minikanren to synthesize minikanren

- TODO: choose paper

Ask if I can map over CS4212
