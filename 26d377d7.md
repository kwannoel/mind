# NP Hard, NP Complete

NP Hard -> Non polynomial time

1. We want to unify all NP Hard problems such that if we solve one of them, we solve the rest as well!
  a. Provide a framework, for the parts we are unsure about, use wishful thinking and leave it as a hole
     That way, we can focus on the *holes* which are the essence of the problem

2. We want to solve NP Hard problems in polynomial time
  a. solve the holes
  
NP Complete -> Find a solution that resolves to satisfiability problem (3-SAT)
