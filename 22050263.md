Sometimes we want to manipulate a *location* inside the data structure, rather than the *data* itself.

Suppose we have a data structure, a tree:
```hs
data Tree a = Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) | Leaf a
```

And a sample tree:
```hs
Branch (Branch (Leaf 1)
               (Leaf 2))
       (Branch (Leaf 3)
               (Leaf 4))
```

In this case let's manipulate the location of the subtree, `Leaf 2`.

To know its location, we need to know its surroundings (*context*) and the place (*focus*)

```hs
tree = Branch (Branch (Leaf 1)
                      (Leaf 2)) -- Location of `Leaf 2`
              (Branch (Leaf 3)
                      (Leaf 4))
               
-- Context surrounding `Leaf 2`
context = Branch (Branch (Leaf 1)
                         _
                 (Branch (Leaf 3)
                         (Leaf 4))

-- Focus of `Leaf 2`
focus = Leaf 2
```

As such we can define the location as a product of `context` and the `focus`:
```hs
type Loc a = (Tree a, Cxt a)
```

Context is in turn defined relative to the hole, where `Context a` refers to the context of the parent, `Tree a` refers to the other child of the parent.
```hs
data Context = Top | L (Context a) (Tree a) | R (Context a) (Tree a)
```

We can then define functions to manipulate locations in the tree:
```hs
left :: Loc a -> Loc a
left (Branch l r, c) = (l, L c r)

right :: Loc a -> Loc a
right (Branch l r, c) = (r, R c l)

top :: Tree a -> Loc a
top t = (t, Top)

up :: Loc a -> Loc a
up (t, L c r) = (Branch t r, c)
up (t, R c l) = (Branch l t, c)

upmost :: Loc a -> Loc a
upmost l@(t, Top) = l
upmost l = upmost (up l)

modify :: Loc a -> (Tree a -> Tree a) -> Loc a
modify (t, c) f = (f t, c)
```
