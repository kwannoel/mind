# Unspent Transaction outputs (UTXO)

Discrete piece of cryptocurrency. For example, bitcoin is in discrete amounts of satoshi.

Each UTXO has an amount associated with it, and is owned by an account.

When a UTXO is used in a transaction it is destroyed, and one of more new UTXO created.

All nodes maintain a set of existing UTXOs, they use this to verify if a given transaction and the cryptocurrency it is attempting to spend is valid.

## Example

Alice owns UTXO worth 1BTC.
Alice wants to pay Bob 0.4BTC.
Alice creates 2 new UTXO:
1. UTXO 0.4BTC to bob
2. UTXO 0.59BTC to herself (change)

Notice there is 0.01BTC missing.
This is implicitly the miner's fee, paid for mining the transaction.
