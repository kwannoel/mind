# workflow problems

- Difficulty integrating diagrams and pictures into emacs.

  - Web interface not responsive to updates, update to latest neuron on `ema`.
  
  - Integrate 3rd party tools which allow me to draw diagrams.
    Alternatively, create a draw buffer in emacs, which integrates with wacom.
    
  - Integrate screenshots easily, save them to the relevant zettel file.
  
  - Integrate images easily, study what needs to be done for an image.
  
  - Something else to consider: provide image uids. Just have a counter which increments.

- emacs script for taking rust deps and extracting latest versions from `cargo search <pkg-name>`.

- open a terminal at the current buffer path.

- Autogen calendar dates to work on critical tasks.
