# Stream processing vs batch processing

## Examples

Stream processing: Log files, real time sensor readings, gamer actions e.g. moba, fps.
Batch processing: collating incoming requests for customers, handling the batch of requests at the end of the day.

## Differences

|            | Batch                                         | Stream                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Freq       | infrequent, produce results when job finished | jobs continuously run and produce results |
| perf       | high latency (minutes to hours)               | low latency (seconds to milliseconds)     |
| data src   | db, apis, static files                        | msg queues, event streams, transactoins   |
| analysis   | complex analysis                              | generally simpler, rising wave is complex |
| processing | process after store                           | process and then store                    |
