# Finding my gateway ip (usually your router's ip, could be vpn as well)

So the default <20366040>  is the one we usually use,
and the address points to your local router.

Examples:
```
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.1
```

On linux You could use to view your device's routing tables, which indicate the network gateway:
```
ip r
route
```
