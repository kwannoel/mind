# How do we perform information retrieval on unstructured data?

If we store using matrix, where x = words, y = documents,

Suppose we have 1 million words & 100_000 documents.

We allocate a huge amount of space.

As such, we should store in adjacency list.

Since we want to lookup words more often than documents, we index by word.

## Steps

1. Create a table matching term & docID

| Term | DocID |
|------|-------|
| I    | 2     |
| I    | 1     |
| did  | 1     |

2. Sort table by terms (alphabetically etc...), followed by docID.

| Term | DocID |
|------|-------|
| did  | 1     |
| I    | 1     |
| I    | 2     |

3. Merge duplicate entries.
