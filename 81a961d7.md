# What is the exact specification of on-chain Plutus Core? Isn't it just untyped lambda calculus at the end state?

What is the expected result of applying a plutus core script?

How do we know it validated something?

In [plutus core specification](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5988492/download/1/plutus-core-specification.pdf),
they have the `(error A)` which is used to terminate computation.

Otherwise the unit type: `()` is returned, which means everything went fine.
