We use the heap to store / allocate data of *unknown size* at compile time.

When storing data on heap we first request a certain amount of space.
The operating system finds an empty spot in the heap that suffices and marks it as in use, returns a pointer to that location's address. This is known as *allocating to the heap*.

It is *slower* than storing on the stack. The operating system has to find a big enough space to hold data, perform bookkeeping for next alloc.
