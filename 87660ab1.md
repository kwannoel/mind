# What is CSS?

CSS stands for [cascading style sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)

It can be used for:

- Layout

- Styling e.g. color, size of headers, links

It is declarative (rules based).

## Rules syntax

We declare the selector (`h1`). This then gets applied to all html components with `h1`.

We then declare key, value pairs of properties.

```
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}
```

## Specification

W3C has a working group for CSS this are generally for people doing implementation of the CSS spec. Not pragmatic for *users*.

Reference Mozilla CSS docs instead.
