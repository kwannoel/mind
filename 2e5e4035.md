Scenario:
Your branches are A, B and master.
B is dependent on A.

commits:

| branches | commits               |
| -        | -                     |
| master   | m                     |
| A        | m -> 1 -> 2           |
| B        | m -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 |

Commits from A have been squashed and merged into master.

| branches | commits               |
| -        | -                     |
| master   | m -> 12               |
| B        | m -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 |

You want to rebase B on master.

I prefer this:
```sh
git rebase --onto master A B
```

Otherwise:
If B has `X` commits on top of A (In this case `X=2`)

```sh
git rebase --onto master HEAD~[X]
```
