Dune, Frank Herbert
```
"I have no fear, for fear is the little death that kills me over and over. Without fear, I die but once."

"I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
```

```
another person's success is not your failure.
```

```
"Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself."

- Marcus Aurelius
```

```
“No man is free who is not a master of himself.”

- Epictetus
```
