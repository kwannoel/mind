# How are various language constructs made concrete?

## Syntax

Use BNF style.

```
EXP ::= ...
      | Exp = Exp [strict(2)]
```

## Configurations

Snapshot of project execution.

1. Remaining program
2. Execution State e.g. registers, mem, stack, PC, rand, in, out, env, etc...

Structured as a nested cell structure (similar to XML). Leaves can be sets, multisets, lists, maps, etc...

Allows you to traverse semantics as state changes.
